<p><b>Season 1</b> of <i><a href="/wiki/Friends" title="Friends">Friends</a></i> aired from September 22, 1994 to May 18, 1995 on <a href="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> in the US.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Season_summary">Season summary</span></h2>
<p>This season introduces the six main characters: Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Joey Tribbiani, Chandler Bing&#160;and Ross Geller.
</p><p>Rachel, who left her fiance at the altar on her wedding day, has come to New York and ends up living with Monica. It establishes early on in the season that Ross has been infatuated with Rachel since the two characters attended high school. Several episodes revolve around his attempts to tell her how he feels. Ross leaves for a fossil dig in China at the end of the season, missing out on Rachel's birthday party but staying long enough to give her a meaningful present: a cameo that was just like the one that belonged to Rachel's grandmother. Chandler accidentally reveals that Ross is in love with Rachel, much to her shock. Rachel realizes that she has feelings for Ross and rushes off to the airport to tell him that she wants to pursue a relationship with him, only to find out that he has a new girlfriend: Julie.
</p><p>Ross's estranged lesbian wife, Carol Willick, is pregnant with his baby. This puts him and Carol's lesbian life partner, Susan Bunch, in an awkward position. When the baby is born at the end of the season, Ross, Carol, and Susan agree to name him Ben: after a name tag on a janitor's uniform worn by Phoebe.
</p><p>The episodic nature of the season sees the other characters having multiple dates, many of which go wrong (Monica dates a minor in one episode). The recurring character of Janice is introduced as a girlfriend Chandler breaks up with in an early episode, but frequently returns to through the ensuing ten seasons.

<ul><li>Up until "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Boobies" title="The One With The Boobies">The One With The Boobies</a>", Monica and Rachel lived in apartment 5, and Joey and Chandler lived in apartment 4. However, it was realized that such low numbers would correspond to apartments on a lower floor, while their apartments were clearly seen to be higher up in the building. Thus the numbers were changed to 20 and 19 respectively.
