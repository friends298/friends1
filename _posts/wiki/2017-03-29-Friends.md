<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="About"> About </span></h2>
<p>Crane and Kauffman began developing <i>Friends</i> under the title "<i>Insomnia Cafe</i>" in November 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, with whom they had previously worked, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the series to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, the series was finally named "<i>Friends</i>" and premiered on NBC's coveted Thursday 8:30 pm timeslot. Filming for the series took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California in front of a live audience. After ten seasons on the network, the series finale was heavily promoted by NBC, and viewing parties were organized around the U.S.. The finale, which was first aired on May 6, 2004, was watched by an average of 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fourth most-watched series finale in television history.
</p><p><i>Friends</i> received positive reviews throughout its run, and became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. The series won many awards and was nominated for 63 Primetime Emmy Awards. The series was also very successful in the ratings, consistently ranking in the top ten in the final primetime ratings. <i>Friends</i> has made a large cultural impact, and the <a href="/wiki/Central_Perk" title="Central Perk">Central Perk</a> coffee house featured prominently in the series has inspired various imitations worldwide. Repeats of the series continue to air worldwide, while each season has been released on DVD. Following the series finale, the spin-off series <i><a href="/wiki/Joey_(TV_Series)" title="Joey (TV Series)">Joey</a></i> was created, and rumors of a film continue to circulate.

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston" title="Jennifer Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a></b> as <b><a href="/wiki/Rachel_Green" title="Rachel Green">Rachel Green</a></b>, is the spoiled but warm-hearted and likeable daughter of a rich vascular surgeon and his wife. Rachel is introduced into the series in the first episode after she leaves her fianc√©, Barry, at the altar, and attempts to live independently without financial support from her parents. She flees from her almost-wedding to New York City to find Monica Geller, her friend from high school. Rachel moves into Monica's apartment and meets Phoebe Buffay, and Joey Tribbiani. Rachel already knows Ross Geller, Monica's brother, as all three went to the same high school and also Chandler Bing as he was Ross's college buddy. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at Central Perk coffee house. She later begins to work in fashion, becoming an assistant buyer, and later a personal shopper, at Bloomingdale's. She eventually becomes a buyer at Polo Ralph Lauren. A great deal of Rachel's life throughout the series revolves around her relationship with Ross Geller. At the end of season seven, during Monica's and Chandler's wedding, it is revealed that Rachel is pregnant from a one-night stand with Ross. Initially, Rachel is determined to raise the baby on her own, but later she realizes she needs Ross's help. She decides to move in with Ross, even though the two are not involved in a relationship. Their daughter, Emma, is born during the eighth-season finale. During the tenth season, Rachel is offered a job with Louis Vuitton in Paris. She accepts and prepares to move herself and Emma to France. However, in the series finale, she declines the job offer and famously "gets off the plane". Rachel and Ross get back together in the final moments of the series.

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Courteney_Cox" title="Courteney Cox">Courteney Cox Arquette</a></b> as <b><a href="/wiki/Monica_Geller" title="Monica Geller" class="mw-redirect">Monica Geller</a> </b>is the mother hen of the group, who is known for her obsessive-compulsive and competitive nature. Monica is often jokingly teased by the others, especially her brother Ross, for having been extremely overweight as a child. Monica is an intelligent, kind-hearted person who works primarily as a chef at a variety of restaurants throughout the show. In the second season, Monica falls for her father Jack's (Elliott Gould) friend, Richard Burke (Tom Selleck). Despite the twenty-one year age difference, Monica and Richard are happy, and her parents accept their relationship. However, as a result of Monica yearning for a family but Richard having already had one, they break up at the end of the second season. Monica then pursues a chain of various men until she unexpectedly begins a relationship with her longtime friend, Chandler Bing, at the end of the fourth season, during her brother Ross' wedding to Emily Waltham. Monica and Chandler try to hide their relationship from the rest of the group for much of the fifth season, but eventually everyone finds out. After celebrating their first anniversary in Las Vegas, they move in together and get engaged by the sixth-season finale. After their marriage, Monica and Chandler try to conceive children, only to discover that they are unable to do so. In the final season of the series, they adopt two children, whom they name Erica and Jack.

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Lisa_Kudrow" title="Lisa Kudrow">Lisa Kudrow</a></b> as <b><a href="/wiki/Phoebe_Buffay" title="Phoebe Buffay">Phoebe Buffay</a></b> is an odd, ditzy albeit sweet-natured masseuse who grew up homeless, sometimes telling her friends outlandish tales of life on the street. She is an aspiring musician who plays the guitar and sings songs with somewhat unusual lyrics at the coffee shop. She has an identical twin sister, Ursula (also played by Kudrow), who is just as odd as Phoebe and appeared as a recurring character on Mad About You. After a series of dates and relationships with a number of men, Phoebe meets Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) in season nine, whom she eventually marries in season ten. She also became a surrogate mother for her half-brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi), giving birth to his triplets in the fifth season.

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Matt_Le_Blanc" title="Matt Le Blanc" class="mw-redirect">Matt Le Blanc</a></b> as <b><a href="/wiki/Joey_Tribbiani" title="Joey Tribbiani" class="mw-redirect">Joey Tribbiani</a></b>, is a good-natured but not-so-bright struggling actor and food lover, who becomes mildly famous for his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on a fictionalized version of Days of Our Lives. Joey is a womanizer, with many girlfriends throughout the series, often using his catchphrase pick-up line "How you doin'?" He develops a crush on Rachel in season eight but nothing happens until Rachel falls for Joey at the end of season nine. They date for about a week, becoming official in Barbados but they end the relationship because they can never be more than best friends. Matt Le Blanc got a spin off show called Joey once the series finished because Joey's character didn't have a resolute ending.

Because of this, Chandler later quits his job and becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humour. An intelligent man at the end of the day (despite all his goofy quirkiness), he often mocks his best friend Joey for the latter's stupidity. Chandler is often depicted as being somewhat of a hapless individual, suffering a lot of bad luck while struggling through life and occasionally struggling with an on-and-off smoking addiction. He dated the well-known nasal character Janice who annoyed everyone and eventually aggravated Chandler. However, he eventually falls in deep mutual love with Monica; an emotional Chandler tells her that she "makes him happier than he ever thought he could be" while proposing to her at the close of season six, with the two of them marrying at the close of season seven. By the end of the series, he and Monica adopt twins, whom they name Jack and Erica.

The most intelligent of the six main characters, but at the same time a clumsy, quirky man, Ross is known for being a know-it-all who prides himself on his rationality, despite his clear hopeless romanticism. Monica's older brother, Chandler's college roommate, and Rachel's on-again, off-again boyfriend, Ross has three failed marriages during the series and is involved in an on-and-off relationship with Rachel, which is a main storyline throughout the series.

<p>Series co-creator David Crane wanted all six characters to be equally prominent, and the series was lauded as being "the first true 'ensemble' show". The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate; they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards, opted for collective instead of individual salary negotiations, and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season.	
In their original contracts for the first two seasons, each main cast member was paid $1,600 per episode. Before the third season, the cast threatened to go on strike unless they received pay increases, which resulted in each actor receiving $100,000 per episode. For the series' sixth season, the cast members were offered $250,000 to return. The cast members again entered negotiations before the sixth season, asking for $750,000 per episode, and during the ninth and tenth seasons, received $1 million per episode.	
Behind the scenes, the show was known for its unusually cohesive and unified cast. The six main actors made deliberate efforts, from early on, to keep the show's ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate; notably for a show of its length, the six principals each appeared in every episode of the run. The actors became such close friends that one guest star, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Selleck" title="Tom Selleck">Tom Selleck</a>, reported sometimes feeling left out. The cast remained good friends after the show's run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David Arquette's daughter, Coco. In their official farewell commemorative Friends Til' The End, they each separately acknowledged in their interviews that the cast had become their family.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Storylines_and_format">Storylines and format</span></h2>
<p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Season_One" title="Season One" class="mw-redirect">first season</a></b> introduces the six main characters: <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Green" title="Rachel Green">Rachel Green</a>, <a href="/wiki/Monica_Geller" title="Monica Geller" class="mw-redirect">Monica Geller</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phoebe_Buffay" title="Phoebe Buffay">Phoebe Buffay</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joey_Tribbiani" title="Joey Tribbiani" class="mw-redirect">Joey Tribbiani</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chandler_Bing" title="Chandler Bing">Chandler Bing</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ross_Geller" title="Ross Geller">Ross Geller</a>. Rachel, who left her <a href="/wiki/Barry_Farber" title="Barry Farber">fiance</a> at the altar on her wedding day, has come to New York and ends up living with Monica. It establishes early on in the season that Ross has been infatuated with Rachel since the two characters attended high school. Several episodes revolve around his attempts to tell her how he feels. Meanwhile, Ross's estranged lesbian wife <a href="/wiki/Carol_Willick" title="Carol Willick">Carol</a> is pregnant with his baby. This puts him and Carol's lesbian life partner, <a href="/wiki/Susan_Bunch" title="Susan Bunch">Susan</a> (played by <a href="/wiki/Jessica_Hecht" title="Jessica Hecht">Jessica Hecht</a>), in an awkward position. When the baby is born at the end of the season, Ross, Carol, and Susan agree to name him Ben: after a name tag on a janitor's uniform worn by Phoebe. The episodic nature of the season sees the other characters having multiple dates, many of which go wrong (Monica dates a minor in <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Ick_Factor" title="The One With The Ick Factor">one episode</a>). The recurring character of <a href="/wiki/Janice_Litman_Goralnik" title="Janice Litman Goralnik">Janice</a> (played by <a href="/wiki/Maggie_Wheeler" title="Maggie Wheeler">Maggie Wheeler</a>) is introduced as a girlfriend Chandler breaks up with in an early episode but frequently returns to through the ensuing ten seasons.
</p><p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Season_Two" title="Season Two" class="mw-redirect">second season</a></b> features more serialized storylines; it begins when Rachel discovers that Ross is dating Julie (played by <a href="/wiki/Lauren_Tom" title="Lauren Tom">Lauren Tom</a>), someone he knew from grad school. Julie returns for several episodes early in the season. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross she likes him mirror his own failed attempts in the first season, though the characters eventually begin a relationship that lasts into the following season. Joey, a struggling actor in the first season, gets a part in a fictionalized version of the soap opera <i><a href="/wiki/Days_of_Our_Lives" title="Days of Our Lives" class="mw-redirect">Days of Our Lives</a></i> but loses the part soon after when he angers the writers by saying in an interview that he writes many of his own lines. <a href="/wiki/Tom_Selleck" title="Tom Selleck">Tom Selleck</a> begins a recurring guest role as Dr. Richard Burke. Richard, a friend of Monica and Ross' parents who is recently divorced and with grown children, is 21 years older than Monica but despite this they date for the second half of the season. In the season finale, they end the relationship when they realize that he does not want any more children and she does. The second season also served to deepen Chandler and Joey's friendship. This becomes especially apparent in the episodes in which Joey temporarily moves out and a creepy guy named Eddie (<a href="/wiki/Adam_Goldberg" title="Adam Goldberg">Adam Goldberg</a>) moves in.
</p><p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Season_Three" title="Season Three" class="mw-redirect">third season</a></b> took on a significantly greater serialized format. Rachel begins working at Bloomingdales and Ross becomes jealous of her coworker, Mark. Ross and Rachel break up after Ross sleeps with the hot girl from the copy shop, Chloe. His insistence that he and Rachel were "on a break" becomes a running gag through the remaining seasons. The two show significant animosity towards each other through the second half of the season, though the cliffhanger ending suggests the two reconcile. Interestingly, the first episode after they break up does not focus on the two of them, but on Chandler, who's having a very hard time dealing with the situation, as it reminds him of his parents' divorce. Phoebe, established as having no family except for an identical twin sister, becomes acquainted with her half-brother (played by <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Ribisi" title="Giovanni Ribisi">Giovanni Ribisi</a>) and in the finale discovers her birth mother she never knew she had (played by <a href="/wiki/Teri_Garr" title="Teri Garr">Teri Garr</a>). Joey develops a crush on Kate, his acting partner in a new play. (played by <a href="/wiki/Dina_Meyer" title="Dina Meyer">Dina Meyer</a>) At first, she doesn't harbor feelings for him, even after sleeping together. However, after her boyfriend/director dumps her following a scathing review of the play, she turns to Joey for support. The relationship doesn't last long, as she is given an opportunity on a soap opera in Los Angeles. Monica begins a relationship with <a href="/wiki/List_of_recurring_characters_in_Friends#Pete_Becker" title="List of recurring characters in Friends" class="mw-redirect">Pete Becker</a>, a millionaire who has a crush on her. (played by <a href="/wiki/Jon_Favreau" title="Jon Favreau">Jon Favreau</a>) At first, she only sees him as a friend, but eventually, the two begin to date. Preparing for what she thinks is a marriage proposal, Pete confides in her that he wants to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion. After seeing him get beat up badly in two matches, she tells him he has to give it up. Since he won't, she breaks up with him.
</p><p>During the <b><a href="/wiki/Season_Four" title="Season Four" class="mw-redirect">fourth season</a></b>, actress Lisa Kudrow became pregnant. This was written into the show by having Phoebe become a surrogate mother to the children of her brother and his wife (played by <a href="/wiki/Debra_Jo_Rupp" title="Debra Jo Rupp">Debra Jo Rupp</a>). Ross and Rachel briefly reconcile in the premiere but soon break up again. During the middle of the season, Monica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet on how well the four know each other. They bribe Joey and Chandler to switch back with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss. Mid-season, having moved on, Ross begins dating an English woman called Emily (played by <a href="/wiki/Helen_Baxendale" title="Helen Baxendale">Helen Baxendale</a>) and the finale, featuring the wedding of the characters, was filmed on location in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together when, after a wedding guest mistakes Monica for Ross' mother, Monica seeks comfort in the arms of a friend. Rachel, depressed by the impending wedding enough to chase away a potential boyfriend in Joshua, attends the wedding at the last minute, intending to tell Ross that she still loves him, but decides not to. Things are thrown into chaos when Ross replaces Emily's name with Rachel's while saying his vows.
</p><p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Season_Five" title="Season Five" class="mw-redirect">fifth season</a></b> follows Monica and Chandler keeping their new relationship a secret from their friends, while Ross' marriage to Emily ends before it even started, following their wedding (Baxendale's pregnancy prevented her from appearing on-screen in all but two episodes). Phoebe starts a relationship with Gary (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Rapaport" title="Michael Rapaport">Michael Rapaport</a>), a police officer she meets after finding his badge. Although leery of moving in with Gary, she eventually relents. The relationship ends with a bang, literally, when Gary shoots a bird outside of their apartment. Monica and Chandler's relationship becomes public and on a trip to Las Vegas, they decide to get married. On a cliffhanger, Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumble out of the wedding chapel. It received Emmy nominations in 1999 for Outstanding Comedy Series.
</p><p>In the <b><a href="/wiki/Season_Six" title="Season Six" class="mw-redirect">sixth season</a></b> premiere Ross and Rachel's marriage is established to be a drunken mistake and, although Ross is reluctant to do so, the two get a divorce (Ross's third) after failing to get an annulment. Monica and Chandler decide just to move into her apartment together and Rachel moves in with Phoebe. Joey, still a struggling actor, gets a female roommate and a part on a cable television series called "Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E", where he stars alongside a robot. Ross gets a job lecturing at New York University and starts dating his college student, Elizabeth (played by <a href="/wiki/Alexandra_Holden" title="Alexandra Holden">Alexandra Holden</a>). <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Willis" title="Bruce Willis">Bruce Willis</a> makes a three-episode cameo as her father. Phoebe and Rachel's apartment catches on fire, causing Rachel to move in with Joey and Phoebe with Chandler and Monica. In the final episodes, Chandler decides to propose to Monica. Trying to make it a surprise, he starts acting like his old commitment-phobic self, telling her he opposes marriage. For a brief moment Monica considers going to back to Richard, who confesses to her that he still loves her and is willing to have children with her. Monica gets wind of Chandler's idea, and attempts to propose to him but breaks down in tears and cannot finish. Chandler then asks her to marry him and the show is ended with celebration with many of the friends who were standing outside the door. It nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series at Emmy Award 2000.
</p><p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Season_Seven" title="Season Seven" class="mw-redirect">seventh season</a></b> largely concerns various wedding-related antics by Monica and Chandler. Joey's television series is canceled but he is offered his old job back on <i>Days of Our Lives</i>. Phoebe's apartment is fixed but due to the way the apartment has been rebuilt, Rachel stays with Joey. The two-part season finale follows Monica and Chandler's wedding, with guest stars that include <a href="/wiki/Kathleen_Turner" title="Kathleen Turner">Kathleen Turner</a> as Chandler's transvestite father. The closing moments of the season reveal that Rachel is pregnant.
</p><p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Season_Eight" title="Season Eight" class="mw-redirect">eighth season</a>'</b>s first episodes follow a "Who's the father?" format, with the father revealed to be Ross in episode two and Rachel telling him in episode three. Joey begins to develop romantic feelings for roommate Rachel and when Joey's feelings are revealed things become awkward for the two. Eventually their friendship returns to its status quo but in the finale, following Rachel's giving birth to a daughter, she accepts an accidental [roposal of marriage from him. The season was regarded as a return to form for the series; its ratings increased as viewers tuned in for comfort following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2002. The first in that category for the series.
</p><p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Season_Nine" title="Season Nine" class="mw-redirect">ninth season</a></b> follows Ross and Rachel living together with baby Emma after she and Joey clear up the misdirected proposal. She soon moves back in with Joey after a fight with Ross. Monica and Chandler, inspired by Ross and Rachel, decide to conceive a child of their own.

</p><p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Season_Ten" title="Season Ten" class="mw-redirect">tenth season</a></b> closes up several storylines; Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together.

<td style="text-align: left;">‚ÄîThe original treatment used by Crane, Kauffman and Bright to pitch the series to NBC.
</td></tr></table>
<p>David Crane and Marta Kauffman began developing three new television pilots ‚Äî which would premiere in the Fall 1994 season ‚Äî following the cancellation of their sitcom, <i>Family Album</i>, by CBS in November 1993. Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about "six people in their 20's making their way in Manhattan" to NBC, which they felt best suited the network's style. Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series <i>Dream On</i>. The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking at a time when the future was "more of a question mark". They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed "everybody knows that feeling", and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time. The team titled the series <i>Insomnia Cafe</i> (other working titles included <i>Across the Hall</i>, <i>Six of One</i> and <i>Friends Like Us</i>), and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.
</p><p>At the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy involving young people living together and sharing expenses. Littlefield wanted the group to share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become "new, surrogate family members". However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life, and found the scripts developed by NBC to be terrible. When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched <i>Insomnia Cafe</i>, Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were. NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed. Kauffman and Crane began writing a pilot script for a show now titled <i>Friends Like Us</i>, which took three days to write. Littlefield wanted the series to represent Generation X and explore a new kind of tribal bonding, but the trio did not share his vision. Crane argued that it was not a series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching. NBC liked the pilot script and ordered the series under another title, <i>Six of One</i>, mainly due to the similar title it shared with the ABC sitcom <i>These Friends of Mine</i>.
</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Casting">Casting</span></h4>
<p>Once it became apparent that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their client to be a part of the series. Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles. The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had replied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and were asked to read for Les Moonves, president of Warner Bros. Television.
</p><p>During the casting process, more changes occurred to the series' storylines. The writers found that they had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors, and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season. Kauffman acknowledged that Joey's character became "this whole new being", and that "it wasn't until we did the first Thanksgiving episode that we realized how much fun Monica's neuroses are." Having worked with Schwimmer before, the series creators wrote the character of Ross with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast. Aniston, Perry and Kudrow were cast based on their auditions.
</p><p>The producers wanted Courteney Cox to portray Rachel; however, Cox asked to play Monica. Kauffman said that Cox had "this cheery, upbeat energy", which was not how they envisioned Monica. When Cox auditioned for the role, the producers were surprised by her direction of the character and she was cast. When Matt LeBlanc auditioned for Joey, he put a "different spin" on Joey. The writers did not originally intend for Joey to be dim, but found it to be a major source of comedy. LeBlanc also gave the character heart, which the writers did not realize Joey had.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing">Writing</span></h6>
<p>In the weeks after NBC's pick up of <i>Friends</i>, Crane, Kauffman and Bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced <i>Seinfeld</i> episodes. Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because "When you're 40, you can't do it anymore. The networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college." According to Crane, the creators felt that utilizing six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for "myriad story lines and give the show legs". The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas. The writers originally planned a big love story between Joey and Monica, as they intended them to be the most sexual of the characters in the series pitch. The idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the time when Kauffman and Crane were writing the pilot script.
</p><p>During the production of the pilot, NBC requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers wanted to keep three story lines of equal weight and refused. NBC thought the cast was too young, and pushed for an older character who could give the young adults advice. Crane and Kauffman were forced to comply, and wrote a draft of an early episode which featured "Pat the cop". Crane found the storyline to be terrible, and Kauffman joked, "You know the kids book, Pat the Bunny? We had Pat the Cop." NBC eventually consented and dropped the idea.
</p><p>The producers would outline the storylines for each season early in the previous summer. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something felt foreign to either the series or a character. Unlike other storylines, the idea for a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikeable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they neither wanted the show to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none.

<p>The first season was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. The NBC executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but eventually consented to the coffee house concept. The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros. Ranch at 4:00 am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning. At the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger Stage 24, which was renamed "The Friends Stage" after the series finale. Filming began in the summer of 1994 in front of a live audience, who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters; a hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes. Each 22-minute episode took six hours to film ‚Äî twice the length of most sitcom tapings ‚Äî mainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script.
</p><p>Although the producers always wanted to find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, <i>Friends</i> was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience was an integral part of the series. When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had to be big enough for the cameras, lighting, and "for the audience to be able to see what's going on"; the apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the funny scripts. The fourth season finale was shot on location in London because the producers knew of the country's large fanbase. The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences of 500 each, the show's largest audiences throughout its run. Although some people thought the season 5 finale was filmed on location in Las Vegas, the episode was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, where they took down the Central Perk set to be replaced with Cesar's Palace (the only time in the show's run that the coffee shop set was taken down).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Broadcast">Broadcast</span></h3>
<p>After the produced pilot lived up to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name <i>Friends</i> on September 22, 1994 on the coveted Thursday 8:30 pm timeslot. The pilot aired between <i><a href="/wiki/Mad_About_You" title="Mad About You">Mad About You</a></i> and <i>Seinfeld</i>, and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that <i>Friends</i> would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money ‚Äî $1 million per episode ‚Äî that it took to bring the series back for another season.
</p><p>After year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10 million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.

<p>The series' creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months before its original airing. Crane, Kauffman and Bright decided to watch finales from other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not. Kauffman found that they liked the ones which stayed true to the series, citing the finale of <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i> as the gold standard. The writers had difficulty writing the finale, and spent several days thinking about the finale scene without being able to write a word. Crane said that they did not want to do "something high concept, or take the show out of the show". The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience, and with a minimum amount of crew. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly. David Schwimmer said the finale was "exactly what I had hoped. We all end up with a sense of a new beginning and the audience has a sense that it's a new chapter in the lives of all these characters."
</p><p>NBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of <i>Dateline NBC</i>, a weekly television newsmagazine, one of which ran for two hours. <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_All_The_Other_Ones" title="The One With All The Other Ones">A one-hour retrospective</a> of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode. Following the finale, <i>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i> was filmed on the set of the <i>Friends'</i> Central Perk cafe, which featured the series' cast as guests. The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2 million for 30 seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the <i>Seinfeld</i> finale at $1.7 million.
</p><p>52.5 million American viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast in six years. Although it was not the series' most-watched episode, the finale was the fourth most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of <i>M*A*S*H</i>, <i>Cheers</i> and <i>Seinfeld</i>, which were watched by 105, 80.4 and 76.2 million viewers respectively. The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36 million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television show of the year, only behind the Super Bowl. Following the finales of <i>Friends</i> and <i>Frasier</i>, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Expressed opinions varied between a signaling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre, and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows. Kauffman and Crane stated that they would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members wanted to continue. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Impact">Impact</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reception">Critical reception</span></h3>
<p>Early reviews of the series were mixed. Tom Feran of <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> wrote that the series traded "vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld", while Ann Hodges of the <i>Houston Chronicle</i> called it "the new Seinfeld wannabe, but it will never be as funny as Seinfeld." In the <i>Los Angeles Daily News</i>, Ray Richmond named the series as "one of the brighter comedies of the new season", and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> called it "flat-out the best comedy series of the new season".
</p><p><i>Chicago Sun-Times'</i> Ginny Holbert found Joey and Rachel's characteristics to be underdeveloped, while Richmond commended the cast as a "likeable, youth ensemble" with "good chemistry". Robert Bianco of <i>USA Today</i> was complementary of Schwimmer, calling him "terrific". He also praised the female leads, but was concerned that Perry's role as Chandler was "undefined" and that LeBlanc was "relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it". The authors of <i>Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends</i> thought that the cast was "trying just a little too hard", in particular Perry and Schwimmer.
</p><p>As the series progressed, reviews became more positive, and <i>Friends</i> became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. Critics commended the series for its consistently sharp writing and the chemistry between the main actors. Noel Holston of <i>Newsday</i>, who had dismissed the pilot as a "so-so Seinfeld wannabe" in 1994, reneged his review after rewatching the episode, and felt like writing an apology to the writers. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com thought that the series "hit its stride" in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations "could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be "original and innovative". Bill Carter of <i>The New York Times</i> called the eighth season a "truly stunning comeback". Carter found that by "generating new hot story lines and high-decibel laughs", the series made its way "back into the hearts of its fans". However, Liane Bonin of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> felt that the direction of the ninth season was a "disappointing buzzkill", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that "the writing [was] still sharp". Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was "alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be."
</p><p>Reviews of the series finale were mixed to positive. <i>USA Today'</i>s Robert Bianco described the finale as entertaining and satisfying, and praised it for deftly mixing emotion and humor while showcasing each of the stars. Sarah Rodman of the <i>Boston Herald</i> praised Aniston and Schwimmer for their acting, but felt that their characters' reunion was "a bit too neat, even if it was what most of the show's legions of fans wanted." Roger Catlin of <i>The Hartford Courant</i> felt that newcomers to the series would be "surprised at how laughless the affair could be, and how nearly every strained gag depends on the sheer stupidity of its characters." Ken Parish Perkins, writing for <i>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</i>, pointed out that the finale was "more touching than comical, more satisfying in terms of closure than knee-slappingly funny."

<p>Although the producers thought of <i>Friends</i> as "only a TV show", numerous psychologists investigated the cultural impact of <i>Friends</i> during the series' run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed "<a href="/wiki/The_Rachel_hairstyle" title="The Rachel hairstyle" class="mw-redirect">The Rachel</a>" and copied around the world. Joey Tribbiani's catchphrase "How <i>you</i> doin'?" has become a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends. The show also popularized the idea of the "laminated list", a list of celebrities that a person's partner will permit them to sleep with if they were to ever meet them. In "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Frank_Jr." title="The One With Frank Jr.">The One With Frank Jr.</a>" the characters exchange "lists" verbally, while Ross creates a physical list and laminates it, making his choices permanent. The concept of the laminated list has been adopted by the Hollywood Stock Exchange website. The series also impacted on the English language, according to a study by a linguistics professor at the University of Toronto. The professor found that the characters used the word "so" as an adjective more often than other intensifiers, such as "very" and "really". Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change. The show is also responsible for popularizing the phrase "going commando".
</p><p>The phrase "Ross and Rachel" has appeared as a joke in <i>Scrubs</i>: the janitor describes J.D.'s relationship with Elliot as "not exactly Ross and Rachel." <i>Friends</i> has been referenced again in the Scrubs episode, "My Cold Shower"; Carla describes J.D and Elliot's relationship as being, "On and off more than Ross and Rachel, from <i>Friends.</i>" Also in Scrubs, when Elliot and J.D. are deciding to get back together, J.D. says "We don't always have to be arguing over if we were on a break", to which Elliot responds "Did you watch the Friends re-run on NBC last night?". On the 100th episode of the television show <i>One Tree Hill</i> (Lucas' and Lindsay's wedding), a character references Ross saying the wrong name at the altar when he was marrying Emily. In one episode of the British show <i>Skins</i>, a Russian girl learns English from <i>Friends</i>, and uses many of the catchphrases (such as "How you doin'" and "We were on a break") as a recurring joke.
</p><p>One of the principal settings of the series, the <a href="/wiki/Central_Perk" title="Central Perk">Central Perk</a> coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide (the coffee house is based on Cholmondeley's, a coffee shop and lounge in Usen Castle at Brandeis University, the alma mater of the show's creators), including the now-defunct "Phoenix Perk" in Dublin (named for the Phoenix Park in the city) and the 'Riverdale Perk' in Toronto. In 2006 Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a "Central Perk" franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The d√©cor of his coffee houses are inspired by that in <i>Friends</i>. <a href="/wiki/James_Michael_Tyler" title="James Michael Tyler">James Michael Tyler</a>, who plays <a href="/wiki/Gunther" title="Gunther">Gunther</a>, the Central Perk waiter in love with Rachel, attended the grand opening of the flagship Dubai caf√© and is the spokesman for the company. Central Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios, and was shown on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i> in October 2008. Lisa Kudrow revisited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004.
</p><p>Additionally, many fans have attempted to recreate the look of the "Friends" apartments. Many companies now sell replicas of props appearing on the sets of Friends. One such example is www.friendsposter.com, which features Monica's famous peephole frame, and many posters that are featured in both Monica and Joey and Chandler's apartments.
</p><p>The name of every <i>Friends</i> episode, with the exceptions of the very first and last episodes (titled "<a href="/wiki/The_Pilot" title="The Pilot">The Pilot</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/The_Last_One" title="The Last One" class="mw-redirect">The Last One</a>" respectively), starts with "The One...", e.g. "The One With Ross' Inappropriate Song", though the Pilot is sometimes called "The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate", or "The One Where It All Began". In continuing with this tradition, a boxed set containing all ten seasons on DVD was called "The One With All Ten Seasons". This tradition is based on the way people, when unable to remember the actual title of an episode of a TV show, will describe it as "it's the one with..." and then state the main storyline of the episode.
</p><p>A parody of <i>Friends</i> was created in Britain called <i>Chums</i> and was aired on SM-TV. It features 3 characters named Ant, Dec and Cat Deely. Cat Deely can be seen as a parody of Rachel's actions. The episodes include short episodes, also beginning with "The One...". Most of the episodes feature pretend shows like Pokefight, based on <i>Pokemon</i>. Also Nickelodeon's 'Snick' used to make short episodes called 'Buds' with the Snick cast. They would act like the friends cast but with different, pointless plots.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Australian_and_New_Zealand_ratings">Australian and New Zealand ratings</span></h3>
<p><i>Friends</i> debuted on Australian television in 1996, on the Seven Network. For the first season, it averaged 1,788,000 viewers per episode, and was the 8th most watched regular program that year. The second season aired on the Nine Network by the end of 1996, and took the number 2 position and averaged 2,291,000 viewers per episode. The third season aired in mid-1997 and saw an increase in its position and viewers, being the most watched regular program, averaging 2,543,000 viewers per episode. Repeats were also averaging 1,918,000 viewers, and they were the 6th most watched regular program of the year. The fourth season aired in 1998, and continued to increase in ratings, averaging 2,586,000 viewers. The fifth season aired in 1999, but saw a slight drop in viewers. It averaged 2,340,000 viewers per episode, but still managed to retain its number one position.
</p><p>The sixth season, aired in 2000, fell into a contentious year for TV ratings in Australia. Previously, ratings had been calculated by Nielsen Media Research, but OzTAM took over. OzTAM showed slight differences in ratings for most shows broadcast on Nine Network, and saw a significant drop in total viewers across all networks. OzTAM had <i>Friends</i> averaging 1,816,000 viewers nationally, and ranked it as the 3rd most watched program of the year. <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research?action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nielsen Media Research (page does not exist)">Nielsen Media Research Australia</a>, however, had <i>Friends</i> averaging 2,340,000 viewers per episode, and ranked it as the most watched program.
</p><p>The eighth season, aired in 2002, saw erratic scheduling of <i>Friends</i> on the <a href="/wiki/Nine_Network?action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nine Network (page does not exist)">Nine Network</a>, and as a result saw a major drop in viewers. It ranked as the 10th most watched regular program that year, averaging 1,629,000 viewers. As a result of the Athens Olympics, <i>Friends</i> saw a decrease in its ratings. It was put on hiatus twice, for periods of four and seven months long respectively. The tenth season averaged 1,716,000 viewers per episode, and was ranked as the 6th most watched program of the year. It was also ranked as the third most watched scripted program. The finale averaged 2,273,000 viewers, though it was not the highest rated episode of <i>Friends</i> ever.
</p><p>While Cable TV channel Arena (a Foxtel and Optus channel) aired <i>Friends</i> repeats daily, channel Nine did not air <i>Friends</i> repeats like it did with another popular US sitcom, <i>Frasier</i>. In November 2007, it was announced that Network Ten had bought the rights to the show (although Nine retains some last season episodes which are replayed late-night, thus making it aired simultaneously by two separate networks), and that it would air it seven nights a week from December 2 screening at 7:00p.m., replacing <i>Futurama</i> repeats. It was also a part of the 2007/2008 summer schedule, meaning that the show has aired on all of Australia's "Big Three" television networks. In February 2008, <i>Friends</i> was moved to the 6pm Monday-Friday timeslot, and replaced long-running 6 p.m. repeats of <i>The Simpsons</i> in Network Ten's regular schedule. Due to sexual content and low level coarse language, many episodes were edited to fit the G ratings, and the first two episodes of the fifth season were cut altogether due to Monica and Chandler's relationship acts. On July 28, 2008, Network Ten moved episodes of <i>Friends</i> to 7pm weeknights, allowing for the episodes to remain unedited.
</p><p>In New Zealand, <i>Friends</i> first debuted on TV2 during the middle of 1995. The show typically screened around 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday nights but some seasons were screened on Sunday nights. Repeats were screened at 7:00 p.m. during December and January between 1996 and 1998 when <i>Shortland Street</i> went off the air for the Summer break. TV2 began screening repeats at 6:30 p.m. from 2000 onwards, running constant repeats of all previous seasons. Currently, the show plays every weeknight at 6:00 p.m. Comedy Central has announced they will screen <i>Friends</i> when TV2 loses the rights around 2015-16.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="British_and_Irish_ratings">British and Irish ratings</span></h3>
<p><i>Friends</i> was originally aired on the terrestrial Channel 4 from 1995 onwards. New episodes were then shown on Sky One in the late 1990s, although the series achieved a more mainstream audience through repeat showings on Channel 4. The program was repeated daily on Channel 4 and S4C in Wales until recently, it is still repeated twice a day on E4 with 2 back-to-back episodes. However during the summer when the 4 network is overridden by <b>Big Brother</b> it is repeated three times a day usually in between shows such as <b>Hollyoaks</b> and <b>Big Brother's Little Brother</b>. 
Friends is currently shown exclusively on Comedy Central in the UK, the episodes are available in HD for the first time in the UK market.
</p><p>The Irish channel RT√â Two was the first channel in Europe to air both the premiere and finale episodes of <i>Friends</i>. The show achieved exceptionally high ratings throughout the initial run, and continues to run twice weekly on RT√â Two, and weekdays on Channel 6.

<p>A wide range of <i>Friends</i> merchandise has been produced by various companies. All ten seasons have been released on DVD individually and as a box set. Warner Bros. has also talked about plans of a future Blu-ray release. Each season release contains special features and footage originally cut from the series. For the first season, each episode is updated with color correction and sound enhancement. In late September 1995, WEA Records released the <i><a href="/wiki/Friends_Original_TV_Soundtrack?action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Friends Original TV Soundtrack (page does not exist)">Friends Original TV Soundtrack</a></i>, containing music featured in previous and future episodes. In between some of the songs, there is spoken dialog from scenes from the show's first season. The soundtrack debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 46, and sold 500,000 copies in November 1995. In 1999, a second soundtrack album entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Friends_Again?action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Friends Again (page does not exist)">Friends Again</a></i> was released. Other merchandise include a <i>Friends</i> version of the DVD game "Scene It?", and a quiz computer game, entitled "Friends: The One with All the Trivia", "hosted" by <a href="/wiki/James_Michael_Tyler" title="James Michael Tyler">James Michael Tyler</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christina_Pickles" title="Christina Pickles">Christina Pickles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elliott_Gould" title="Elliott Gould">Elliott Gould</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maggie_Wheeler" title="Maggie Wheeler">Maggie Wheeler</a> as their respective characters from the series.
</p><p>All ten seasons were re-released in region 2 on October 25, 2004. For region 1, when Season Ten was released on November 15, 2005, the WB made a limited edition box called "The One With All Ten Seasons" to fit all individual ten seasons in. The collection was cased in wood with black covering and a plastic door with all of the Friends pictured on it. One year later, the WB released <a href="/wiki/Friends_-_The_Complete_Series_Collection" title="Friends - The Complete Series Collection" class="mw-redirect">The Complete Series</a>, cased in a red box with an exclusive booklet about the show, cast, and original pilot pitch. Instead of individually boxing and organizing the shows by season, this collection organized the 40 discs into volumes sorted by how many episodes to a disc, and they were split up by a disc holder for each cast member. This version was released in the UK on 12 November 2007.

<p>After the series finale in 2004, LeBlanc signed on for the spin-off series, <i>Joey</i>, following Joey's move to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. Kauffman and Crane were not interested in the spin-off, although Bright accepted to executive produce the series with Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan. NBC heavily promoted Joey and gave it <i>Friends'</i> Thursday 8:00 pm timeslot. <a href="/wiki/Pilot_(Joey)" title="Pilot (Joey)">The pilot</a> was watched by 18.60 million American viewers, but ratings continually decreased throughout the series' two seasons, averaging 10.20 million viewers in the first season and 7.10 million in the second. The final broadcast episode on March 7, 2006 was watched by 7.09 million viewers; NBC canceled the series on May 15, 2006 after two seasons. Bright blamed the collaboration between NBC executives, the studio and other producers for quickly ruining the series: "On <i>Friends</i> Joey was a womanizer but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on. Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn't get a job, couldn't ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard."
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Film">Film</span></h3>
<p>Following the series finale, rumors began to emerge of a <i>Friends</i> film, although all were proven to be untrue. Rumors of a film reemerged after the release of the <i>Sex and the City</i> film in 2008, which proved to be a success at the box office. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> reported in July 2008 that the main cast members had agreed to star in the project, and that filming was going to start within the next 18 months. A source commented that "Jennifer, Courteney and the rest of the cast are [eager] to reprise their roles, under the right circumstances [...] Jennifer says she and Courteney have already talked this summer about what they want out of a <i>Friends</i> movie." When asked about the film, Kudrow said that she was unaware of the talks, but expressed interest in the idea. However, the director of publicity for Warner Bros. said there was "no truth in the story", and Perry's spokeswoman added that "nothing is happening in this regard, so the rumor is false."
