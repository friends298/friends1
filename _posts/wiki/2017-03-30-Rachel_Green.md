<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_Life">Early Life</span></h3>
<p>Rachel Karen Green was born to <a href="/wiki/Leonard_Green" title="Leonard Green">Leonard</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sandra_Green" title="Sandra Green">Sandra Green</a>, who gave her and her two sisters <a href="/wiki/Jill_Green" title="Jill Green">Jill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amy_Green" title="Amy Green">Amy</a>, a rather spoiled upbringing. She met <a href="/wiki/Monica_Geller" title="Monica Geller" class="mw-redirect">Monica</a> Geller for the first time when they were both six years old and they quickly became best friends, remaining exactly that from then until attending the same high school. Rachel also soon met Monica's older brother, <a href="/wiki/Ross" title="Ross" class="mw-redirect">Ross</a>, who developed a crush on her which he ultimately decided to keep to himself.
</p><p>She was also involved with an unpleasant-natured fellow high school student named Chip, who arrived late to take her out to the high school prom. When it appeared that Chip was never going to arrive, Ross, after being encouraged by his parents <a href="/wiki/Jack_Geller" title="Jack Geller">Jack</a> and <a href="/wiki/Judy_Geller" title="Judy Geller">Judy</a>, decided to ask her out himself, but missed his chance when Chip arrived before he could ask her. She soon learned how unpleasant, careless and unfaithful at his core Chip was when he ditched her at the prom to have sex with another girl named <a href="/wiki/Amy_Welsh" title="Amy Welsh">Amy Welsh</a>.
</p><p>Rachel herself, however, was a bully to an overweight student named <a href="/wiki/Will_Colbert" title="Will Colbert">Will Colbert</a>, spurring him and his friend, Ross, who dealt with the fact that she never seemed to notice his feelings for her in a very immature way, to form an <a href="/wiki/%22We-Hate-Rachel%22_Club" title="&quot;We-Hate-Rachel&quot; Club" class="mw-redirect">"I Hate Rachel Green" Club</a> and spread a rumour about her, saying that she, as Ross put it, "had both male and female reproductive parts" and that, as Will put it, "her parents flipped a coin and decided to raise her as a girl" which everyone in the entire high school (apart from Rachel herself) heard (which may or may not have influenced Chip's unfaithfulness towards her).
</p><p>Rachel also met <a href="/wiki/Chandler_Bing" title="Chandler Bing">Chandler Bing</a> for the first time at Thanksgiving at Ross and Monica's house. Eventually drifting apart from Monica and Ross, Rachel met and got engaged to an orthodontist named Barry Farber, another careless and unpleasant-natured individual who was unfaithful toward her, cheating on her with both her best friend, <a href="/wiki/Mindy" title="Mindy" class="mw-redirect">Mindy</a> and her selfish, shallow, unpleasant, self-absorbed sister Amy (although she didn't learn of this until after she eventually broke it off with him). Later, though, Rachel sleeps with him while he's engaged to Mindy, her former best friend.

Her search for <a href="/wiki/Monica" title="Monica" class="mw-redirect">Monica</a>, who she hasn't spoken to in several years, ends as she sees her and tells her what happened. Monica introduces Rachel to the rest of the group: Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and also reunites her with Ross, who eventually decides to suggest that he may someday ask her out on a date, a proposition she does not object to. Rachel confronts her father over the phone about her fleeing from the wedding and announces that she's moving in with Monica. She is excited about this new phase in life, until she is forced to get a job because her father has cut her off financially. She becomes a waitress at Central Perk. <small>("<a href="/wiki/The_Pilot" title="The Pilot">The Pilot</a>")</small>

He also reveals that he went on their honeymoon with Mindy, which makes Rachel even more upset.

Later on Rachel asks to know all the new gossip and is upset to find out that it's all about her leaving Barry. Rachel tries to assure the women that her life is great but they are not impressed with her job as a waitress. Rachel and Monica are having their best friend Phoebe spend the night and Rachel gets a call from the Visa company because they noticed she hasn't been using her credit card. Rachel then gets depressed and Monica and Phoebe attempt to cheer her up. Later on the roles are reversed and Rachel has to cheer them up. Then the wrong pizza is sent to their house. <small>("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_George_Stephanopoulos" title="The One With George Stephanopoulos">The One With George Stephanopoulos</a>")</small>
<p>Ross falsely claims that his laundromat has suffered a rat infestation so he can spend time with Rachel at her laundromat. Rachel gets into an argument with a bully at the laundry mat who attempts to steal her machine, even though the former had already placed her basket on top of the aforementioned machine. Ross stands up for Rachel and the bully leaves, but not before placing a red sock in the basket, causing all of Rachel's white clothes to turn pink. The same woman later steals Rachel's cart but her wacky, quirky personality enables her to come up with the perfect method of putting the bully in her place-not starting a fight, but jumping into the cart and angrily saying that if the woman wants to take the cart, she will have to take Rachel with it. Outsmarted, the bully slinks away in defeat. <small>("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_East_German_Laundry_Detergent" title="The One With The East German Laundry Detergent">The One With The East German Laundry Detergent</a>")</small>
</p><p>At Rachel's apartment, Monica reveals how obsessive she is with cleanliness and organization when she disapproves of Rachel's subtle changes to the living room after cleaning it. The guys think it's pretty much a flaw of Monica's, but she tries not to make a big deal out of it. However, she can't even bring herself to sleep by thinking of a pair of sneakers she left haphazardly in the living room just to let the guys think that she, like them, is a "kook". <small>("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Butt" title="The One With The Butt">The One With The Butt</a>")</small>
</p><p>During a blackout, Ross decides to make a move on Rachel after seeing her out on the balcony, since it's the perfect romantic spot. Before he can get a chance to inform her of his true feelings however, a cat jumps on to his back, and he panics and flails around, trying to throw off the cat, which has by now dug its claws into him. Ross and Rachel come back in with the cat and Rachel decides to search through the apartment building in a hunt for the cat's owner, which turns out to be a handsome Italian man, Rachel brings Paolo back and introduces the rest of the friends to him-it is clear to them all that she is attracted to him despite the fact that he doesn't speak much English, making Ross jealous. When the power turns back on, Rachel is kissing Paolo which makes Ross upset. <small>("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Blackout" title="The One With The Blackout">The One With The Blackout</a>")</small>
</p><p>Rachel attends the funeral for Monica and Ross's grandmother. Paolo had to go back to Italy for a while and he sent Rachel some expensive dress shoes. While at the funeral, Rachel messed up one of the shoes. Ross hurts his back at the funeral and tells Rachel he loves her but she thinks it's just the painkillers he has taken talking. <small>("<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Nana_Dies_Twice" title="The One Where Nana Dies Twice">The One Where Nana Dies Twice</a>")</small>

Rachel opens her birthday presents and is touched that Ross gave her an antique cameo that she had seen at an antique shop months prior and mentioned that it reminded her of one her grandmothers had owned. Chandler accidentally lets it slip that Ross loves her by reminding the group that Ross bought Carol an expensive gift when he first fell in love with her. She goes to the airport to try and talk to him before he boards the plane, after realizing she has feelings for him too. Annoyingly, he has on headphones, so she isn't able to flag him down tell him how she feels. <small>("<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Rachel_Finds_Out" title="The One Where Rachel Finds Out">The One Where Rachel Finds Out</a>")</small>

<p>Rachel goes to the airport to greet Ross when he comes back from China, then tries to leave in a hurry when she sees he has come back with a woman he is intimate with, and falls over, causing the couple to notice her. She acts incredibly cold to Julie and does everything she can to sabotage her relationship with Ross, including making <a href="/wiki/Phoebe_Buffay" title="Phoebe Buffay">Phoebe</a> cut her hair "Planet of the Apes" style and trying to convince Ross to avoid sleeping with her, saying it makes women really hot for a guy if he makes her wait. In an attempt to move on from her feelings for Ross, Rachel goes on a blind date, but spends the whole evening drinking wine and talking about the situation with Ross. Rachel gets drunk and leaves a message on Ross's answering machine, claiming that she is over him. Ross listens to the message the next morning, becoming confused and a little angry. He goes to Central Perk later that night to confront Rachel, and they share their first kiss.

</p><p>In "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_List" title="The One With The List">The One With The List</a>", Ross's list of pros and cons (Julie versus Rachel) repels Rachel from him because she can't stand the fact that he would use the list as reasons not to be with her. She starts dating Russ, a guy who is in every way like Ross, but claims to not see the similarities until witnessing the two argue using the same vocal inflections and depressed, nasal "hi" when they see her. She gets grossed out by the situation and ends things with Russ. After watching her and Monica's prom video, Rachel realizes that Ross did actually try to confess his feelings back then. Overwhelmed by the fact that he was willing to be her date to the senior prom, Rachel walks up to Ross and kisses him ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Prom_Video" title="The One With The Prom Video">The One With The Prom Video</a>"). Their first date does not end well, as Rachel can't stop laughing when Ross touches her butt. Eventually, they get over this small problem and sleep together for the first time in the museum's planetarium, where Ross has taken her to view the night sky ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Ross_And_Rachel...You_Know" title="The One Where Ross And Rachel...You Know" class="mw-redirect">The One Where Ross And Rachel...You Know</a>").
</p><p>Rachel's mother visits, announcing that she is leaving Rachel's father. This is a bomb for Rachel, who struggles to find compromise between her parents. She also has to face <a href="/wiki/Barry_Farber" title="Barry Farber">Barry's</a> marriage to <a href="/wiki/Mindy" title="Mindy" class="mw-redirect">Mindy</a>, for whom Rachel is a bridesmaid ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Barry_And_Mindy%27s_Wedding" title="The One With Barry And Mindy's Wedding">The One With Barry And Mindy's Wedding</a>"). The whole wedding is a fiasco: Rachel presents herself at the wedding in a pink marshmallow dress; walks up the aisle with her butt showing; discovers that Barry told everyone that she had syphilis and a nervous breakdown after leaving him at the altar; and is the target of repeated jokes by the best man and a bet placed by Barry in which she would be out of the wedding by 9:45. She does, however, have the guts to stay through the whole wedding and sing "Copacabana" in front of everyone, referencing an earlier humiliation that she mentioned to Ross about not being able to sing it at a talent show due to stage fright.

<p>Rachel asks Ross for any sexual fantasies he has. He admits that he likes the Star Wars scene with Princess Leia in the gold bikini, which she re-enacts for him ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Princess_Leia_Fantasy" title="The One With The Princess Leia Fantasy">The One With The Princess Leia Fantasy</a>"). Being in a relationship with Ross for quite some time now, the two act as relationship counselor for Chandler, and gives him advice on how to behave with Janice (his annoying on-and-off girlfriend) in various situations. ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Jam" title="The One With The Jam">The One With The Jam</a>")
</p><p>Rachel has some casual issues in the next few episodes, such as having trouble with being the peacemaker between Ross and her father. Although they do find Rachel's flaws an interesting subject at brunch the next day (<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Race_Car_Bed" title="The One With The Race Car Bed">The One With The Race Car Bed</a>). On Thanksgiving Day, the friends decide to play football while they wait for dinner to finish cooking. Rachel is the last to be picked, since she is terrible at sports. Ironically, she is the one who wins the game for the girls ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Football" title="The One With The Football">The One With The Football</a>"). Sometime later, she is convinced by Chandler and Joey to quit her waitress job at Central Perk, ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Rachel_Quits" title="The One Where Rachel Quits">The One Where Rachel Quits</a>") so she can be free to pursue a career in fashion. Much to her chagrin, she gets a job pouring coffee at a clothing store. At the <a href="/wiki/Moondance_Diner" title="Moondance Diner">Moondance Diner</a>, Rachel meets Mark from Bloomingdale's, who helps her get a job in his department. This is the cause of Ross' jealousy ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_All_The_Jealousy" title="The One With All The Jealousy">The One With All The Jealousy</a>"), which leads to some issues between him and Rachel.
</p><p>Rachel has to work on her and Ross's one-year anniversary. Wanting to make a romantic gesture, Ross brings a picnic to her office, setting out the food and candles while she frantically tries to sort out an incorrect shipment that her department received. After Ross accidentally sets the flowers on her desk on fire, Rachel kicks him out of the office. Ross waits for her at the ladies' apartment, where they have a serious argument that ends with Rachel telling Ross that they should, "take a break." Rachel spends the evening alone, until Mark calls and insists on coming over with Chinese food to talk things out and be a shoulder to cry on. In the meantime, at a bar, Chandler convinces Ross to call Rachel. When he hears Mark's voice over the phone, however, Ross assumes the worst: that Rachel is now involved with Mark. Ross hangs up on Rachel and spends the night with <a href="/wiki/Chloe" title="Chloe">Chloe</a>, the copy girl from the Xerox place ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Ross_And_Rachel_Take_A_Break" title="The One Where Ross And Rachel Take A Break">The One Where Ross And Rachel Take A Break</a>"). Rachel feels awful how she left things with Ross, and makes up with him at his apartment, while Chloe is still there trying to get her clothes together and leave. Things are going well for the couple until <a href="/wiki/Gunther" title="Gunther">Gunther</a> tells Rachel about Ross's night with Chloe. The fight she and Ross have at her apartment is the worst one ever, trapping the rest of the gang in Monica's bedroom. They break up, tearfully and sadly. ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Morning_After" title="The One With The Morning After">The One With The Morning After</a>")
</p><p>Rachel and Ross bicker all the time following the breakup, with Ross constantly reminds Rachel that they, "were on a break!" while Rachel is convinced that Ross cheated on her. The anger they feel is so extreme that Rachel invites everyone but Ross for a weekend ski trip. However, she is forced to accept his help when Phoebe's car runs out of gas on the way, but does not concede to allow Ross to join the rest of the friends on the trip. It is when Ross gives her back her favorite t-shirt (one that used to belong to Ross) that she decides to work on forgiving him (<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Tiny_T-Shirt" title="The One With The Tiny T-Shirt">The One With The Tiny T-Shirt</a>). Ross insists on taking Rachel to the hospital after she breaks her rib, missing out on an appearance on a TV program to help her. When Rachel finds out about the sacrifice Ross has made on her behalf, she tells him that it's the sweetest thing he's ever done. (<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_A_Chick_And_A_Duck" title="The One With A Chick And A Duck">The One With A Chick And A Duck</a>)
</p><p>When Phoebe asks her for permission to set up Ross with Bonnie, she does not give her the go-ahead until Phoebe mentions that Bonnie's bald. When Rachel finds out that Bonnie is no longer bald, she becomes upset (<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Ultimate_Fighting_Champion" title="The One With The Ultimate Fighting Champion">The One With The Ultimate Fighting Champion</a>). Rachel is so jealous that she convinces Bonnie to shave her head so that Ross will break up with her. They even share a kiss, after which she goes upstairs to wait for him.

<p>Ross enters Rachel's room, surprised when he sees Rachel applying after-sun lotion on Bonnie's bald, sunburned head. Bonnie heads back into the bedroom, and Ross and Rachel resume their interrupted kiss. Things don't go beyond this, as Ross insists that he must break up with Bonnie. He ends his relationship with Bonnie, who takes a cab back to her home. Rachel, meanwhile, has written an 18-page letter which she wants Ross to read before they get back together. Having failed to go through the whole letter, Ross wakes up in the morning and tells a worried Rachel that he read the entire letter twice. He is thrown off-course when she asks him, "Does it?" He unknowingly agrees that it does, which leads Rachel to get back together with him. Ross finds out that he unknowingly agreed to take full responsibility for everything which went wrong in their relationship. The couple have sex in Rachel's bedroom, but her continuous references to the letter makes their break-up definitive. When she accuses him of cheating on her with Chloe, Ross explodes, yelling, "<b>We were on a break!!!</b>" Needless to say, their relationship ends once again.
Rachel does what she can to humiliate and provoke Ross. For example, she forces him to apologize to a cat (<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Cat" title="The One With The Cat">The One With The Cat</a>). Things with Ross reached their peak in a dating war which Ross begins by dating a single mother, leading to Rachel dating a college student. It takes a sick Monica to reveal the truth about Ross's babysitting "dates" and Rachel's thieving college boyfriend.

Money is not enough to bet, and both teams are tied in the end. Eventually, the girls lose their apartment to Chandler and Joey.

Her crush comes at a costly price, and her boss's niece ends up with Ross (<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Joey%27s_Dirty_Day" title="The One With Joey's Dirty Day">The One With Joey's Dirty Day</a>). In order to attract Joshua, Rachel throws a surprise party for Emily Waltham, her boss's niece and Ross's new girlfriend. She suggests a game of Spin the Bottle as a weak attempt to kiss Joshua, and is frustrated when Joey and Emily keep spinning and landing on each other. When she spins the bottle and it lands on Joshua, her attempt at kissing him is interrupted when Phoebe feels the triplets kicking for the first time. Trying to seduce Joshua further, Rachel performs a cheerleading act, only to chip a tooth. She tries to slyly pull her bra out through her sleeve, which doesn't work. With a bra stuck in her sleeve and a chipped tooth, Rachel is crushed when she hears that Joshua thinks it's not the right time for him to date as he just got divorced. Soon after, he comes back to kiss her ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Fake_Party" title="The One With The Fake Party">The One With The Fake Party</a>").

</p><p>Ross invites Rachel to his wedding in London. She RSVPs that she can't come, claiming to Ross that she can't have the time off of work and that someone should stay have with Phoebe who is too far along in her pregnancy to fly, but confides in Monica that with the history between her and Ross it would be too painful (<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Invitation" title="The One With The Invitation">The One With The Invitation</a>). Phoebe makes her reason things out, and Rachel realizes she's still in love with Ross. Determined to share her feelings with Ross, Rachel sets off to London, leaving a very frantic Phoebe behind. Phoebe calls Joey to warn him about Rachel coming to ruin Ross' wedding, but Rachel can't bring herself to tell Ross when she sees how happy he is with Emily. All she is able to say is, "Congratulations." The wedding begins with Rachel sitting among the guests. During the vows, Ross looks at Emily and says "Rachel" instead of "Emily".

<p>Rachel is surprised as anyone else to hear <a href="/wiki/Ross_Geller" title="Ross Geller">Ross</a> say her name, instead of "Emily," but the wedding goes on. Emily angrily shoves the ring onto Ross's finger, and Judy Geller remarks that the wedding is turning out, "worse than when he married the lesbian." Rachel interrupts Monica and Chandler's plans to have sex when she goes to chat on the phone with Phoebe about the turnout of events. Rachel is crushed to overhear Ross remark that she doesn't mean anything to him. In the end, she agrees to join him on his honeymoon as a friend. Emily arrives to see them departing together. Ross realizes what it looks like and chases his wife, leaving Rachel alone on the plane to Greece.

Seeing a depressed Ross on the couch, Rachel decides to blow her date off and console Ross with the goal of telling him her feelings. She does tell him, but she realizes the absurdity of the statement. After laughing hysterically, Ross is at first offended thinking that it was a mean joke, but when she assures him that it was genuine and continuing to laugh at herself, Ross begins to see the humor in his own pain and makes jokes about not knowing his wife's whereabouts since the wedding. Rachel calms down and wants to be sure that things will not now be weird between the two of them, noting that he is married to Emily. He reassures her and says "it's always nice to hear that somebody loves you." ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_All_The_Kissing" title="The One With All The Kissing">The One With All The Kissing</a>")

When she finds out what he agreed to, she gets mad at him, and fears that like Chandler's old roommate Kip, she will be forced to leave the group because Ross has a stronger claim to Monica and Chandler. She gets Phoebe to agree come with her to start a new group, and Phoebe wants Joey to come as well. Ross gets wind of something being up from Joey and tells Rachel that if anyone has to leave the group, it will be him because his actions and choices led to the situation that they are in ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Kips" title="The One With The Kips">The One With The Kips</a>"). Rachel tells Ross that she does not feel any better, because she still will not be able to see him. When he does see her one last time and tells Emily over the phone about her presence in the room, Emily is angry, but says that things will be better when she comes and can know where he is at all times. Thrown by this comment, Ross tells Emily that she will have to have some trust in him if they are going to stay married. Upon realizing that she cannot trust him, they decide to divorce.

Phoebe tries to catch the attention of Monica and Chandler across the street and is horrified to see them kissing and pulling off each other's clothes. They conspire to make their lives miserable in various ways to mess with them for keeping secrets--much to the chagrin of Joey who is tired of keeping the secret himself. When Monica says that she will go do laundry (when she is really sneaking away to be with Chandler), Rachel gives her a huge bag of dirty clothes to throw in. Phoebe aggressively hits on Chandler until he can't keep up with the ruse and admits to loving Monica. They still don't want Ross to know, but due to their unfortunate habit of never closing the drapes, he finds out while showing his boss from the museum that he is getting his life back in order.

Rachel takes care of the forms, albeit in an extravagant manner which makes Ross appear to be a gay heroin addict. They argue and Ross's revelations about their history as a couple make the judge determine that they do not qualify for an annulment and must get a divorce instead. When signing the papers that a still angry Ross has brought over, Rachel confesses to him that this divorce is actually her fault, as she was the one to drunkenly suggest the marriage.

It is later revealed that Rachel didn't take the news seriously because they almost got married in Vegas, and since they didn't, she doesn't think this would happen either.

After talking to Joey, Monica and Chandler decide that if they are having such a hard time progressing their relationship, it must not be meant to be, musing that perhaps they are just better friends than Chandler and Monica were and each telling the other "I love you."

He rejects her offer because he doesn't want to take advantage of her in her time of grieving, but instead she feels angry and embarrassed, causing him to then declare that from now on, sex is "off the table". However, she informs him that, "With us, it's never off the table".

Ross doesn't remember him, until Rachel reminds him of the fact that Ross was insanely jealous of Mark. Ross becomes jealous yet again, until he learns that Mark is married and has twins. Mark offers a job to Rachel at Louis Vuitton, but the job requires her to work in Paris. Monica throws Rachel a going away party where Rachel says goodbye to everybody except Ross, much to his dismay. Rachel later shows up at Ross's apartment, explaining that she couldn't say goodbye to him because it was too difficult due to the fact that he means more to her than the others. Just as she's about to leave, Ross kisses her. Ross is convinced that his passionate night with Rachel means that she is going to stay, and he is heartbroken when she announces that she still plans to leave, and she does. Ross realizes that he must let Rachel know how he feels about her, and hopes confessing his love will persuade Rachel to stay in New York. Ross chases her down to the airport, and confesses his love, and begs her to stay. Confused, Rachel gets on the plane. A broken hearted Ross goes to his apartment and checks the messages on his answering machine. He then hears a message from Rachel who had been trying to get off the plane until the line suddenly cuts off, leaving Ross wondering whether she got off the plane until he hears a voice behind him say "I got off the plane."

In the final scene, they are shown holding hands.

In <a href="/wiki/Season_1" title="Season 1">Season 1</a>, it is short and brown until <a href="/wiki/Season_3" title="Season 3">Season 3</a>, when it becomes longer. In <a href="/wiki/Season_4" title="Season 4">Season 4</a>, her hair turns blonde. At the end of <a href="/wiki/Season_6" title="Season 6">Season 6</a>, her hair becomes even longer. Later in <a href="/wiki/Season_7" title="Season 7">Season 7</a>, her hair is chopped off into a short bob. By the end of the series, her hair is fairly long again, going down to her shoulders and is brown again with side-swept bangs.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Rachel's personality evolves somewhat over the series. Early on, she is portrayed as a spoiled girl. She can often be self-centered, but is often sweet and tries to be a good friend. Later on in the series, especially after she gives birth, she becomes much less self-absorbed. As a girl used to having people at her beck and call, Rachel admits to <a href="/wiki/Mr._Treeger" title="Mr. Treeger">Mr. Treeger</a> that she has never taken the trash out. When Treeger yells at her for clogging up the trash chute, which he had unclogged shortly before with a lot of efforts, Rachel returns to the apartment in tears and exaggerates the situation. Monica dismisses the exaggerations, saying Rachel always cries. ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Ballroom_Dancing" title="The One With The Ballroom Dancing">The One With The Ballroom Dancing</a>")
</p><p>As teasingly established in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Joke" title="The One With The Joke">The One With The Joke</a>", Rachel has a reputation for being a "pushover". For instance, in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Cheap_Wedding_Dress" title="The One With The Cheap Wedding Dress">The One With The Cheap Wedding Dress</a>", when Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe attend a sale in Brooklyn to find Monica's wedding dress, a confrontation takes place. Rachel is found huddled in a rack, terrified, blowing her panic whistle. When told to get up, Rachel insists that Phoebe hold her hand.
</p><p>Instances of Rachel standing up for herself are far and few. For instance, in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_East_German_Laundry_Detergent" title="The One With The East German Laundry Detergent">The One With The East German Laundry Detergent</a>" she is bullied by a <a href="/wiki/The_Horrible_Woman" title="The Horrible Woman">horrible woman</a> at the Laundromat but gets to assert herself when Ross encourages her. In "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Rachel%27s_Sister" title="The One With Rachel's Sister">The One With Rachel's Sister</a>", she angrily confronts Ross but fails to impress anyone. Exceptionally, however, she gets to strong arm her sister, <a href="/wiki/Jill_Green" title="Jill Green">Jill Green</a>, in the same episode and Joey in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Rachel%27s_Book" title="The One With Rachel's Book">The One With Rachel's Book</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Phoebe%27s_Cookies" title="The One With Phoebe's Cookies">The One With Phoebe's Cookies</a>" entirely on her own. She also claims to have punched a woman in the face for trying to steal her umbrella though there is only her word for it. ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Joey%27s_Dirty_Day" title="The One With Joey's Dirty Day">The One With Joey's Dirty Day</a>")
</p><p>Despite the personality evolution, Rachel is used to lying. Most significantly, in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Joey%27s_Porsche" title="The One With Joey's Porsche">The One With Joey's Porsche</a>", she commits slander in a legal court, accusing Ross of being mentally unstable, being an intravenous drug addict and having failed to consummate his marriage. Very often, lies are told to inflict damage. For example, in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Ross%27_New_Girlfriend" title="The One With Ross' New Girlfriend">The One With Ross' New Girlfriend</a>", she deliberately misleads Phoebe in hopes of ruining <a href="/wiki/Julie" title="Julie">Julie</a>'s haircut out of jealousy. Also in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_At_The_Beach" title="The One At The Beach">The One At The Beach</a>", Rachel tricked <a href="/wiki/Bonnie" title="Bonnie">Bonnie</a> into shaving her head. There are also instances of deceit that are more impulsive than deliberate, such as claiming that Monica hurt her ankle in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Phoebe_Runs" title="The One Where Phoebe Runs">The One Where Phoebe Runs</a>" or assuming a fake Indian accent in NYU. Nevertheless, they don't justify the act. In "The One With Rachel's Sister", Rachel dismissed Jill's fake crying as a deceitful invention of her own that would not fool its inventor.
</p><p>Rachel is shown to not like to take any responsibility for things, which is seen in <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Jellyfish" title="The One With The Jellyfish">The One With The Jellyfish</a>, when she wants Ross to take all the responsibility for everything that went wrong in their relationship, when they were both at fault. Rachel also has a very jealous side of her when it comes to girlfriends of Ross or women he likes', despite not being with him or interested in dating him. This is shown mostly in <a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Chandler_Can%27t_Cry" title="The One Where Chandler Can't Cry">The One Where Chandler Can't Cry</a>, and <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Cooking_Class" title="The One With The Cooking Class">The One With The Cooking Class</a>. This is also shown when guys she likes, mention they have a girlfriend. Its shown in <a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Monica_Sings" title="The One Where Monica Sings">The One Where Monica Sings</a>, that Rachel is a bit of a hypocrite since she gets mad at Ross for not giving her a guy's phone number and moves back with Joey because of this, but in the season 8 episode, <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Cooking_Class" title="The One With The Cooking Class">The One With The Cooking Class</a>, she doesn't want him to date other women because of the baby coming. However, despite these issues, Rachel has matured more in the later seasons, especially seasons 8 -10.

<p>One of Rachel's closest friends is Monica, her best friend since they were six-years-old. In high school, Rachel was a popular cheerleader with a string of boyfriends. Meanwhile, Monica was her less attractive and overweight best friend. They lost contact for a number of years, to the point where Monica was convinced that she would never become close friends with Rachel again. However, they became close again when Rachel left <a href="/wiki/Barry" title="Barry" class="mw-redirect">Barry</a> and moved in with her.
</p><p>During the period that they live together, Rachel is revealed to be an exceptionally good roommate. As Monica tells Phoebe, Rachel has sweet little quirks, such as folding back the pages in catalogs of things she thinks Monica would like. She also leaves messages on the mirror when Monica takes a shower, and lets Monica borrow her hundred-plus pairs of boots.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Phoebe_Buffay"> Phoebe Buffay  </span></h3>
<p>Rachel's other best friend. Phoebe first met Rachel in the pilot episode when Rachel leaves Barry and comes to live with Monica.
</p><p>In a season 5 episode "The One With The Kips", Phoebe and Rachel consider starting a new group of friends with Joey after Emily (Ross's wife at the time) demands that Ross doesn't see Rachel anymore. Rachel says "We can start a new group, you and me, we're the best ones," to which Phoebe responds "Okay. But let's try to get Joey." This never happened as Ross could not go without seeing Rachel and the group remained as it was.
</p><p>From seasons 6–7, Rachel and Phoebe lived together after Chandler moved into Monica's apartment. In "The One Where Ross Dates A Student", Phoebe and Rachel's apartment catches fire, causing Phoebe to temporarily live with Monica and Rachel to live with Joey. Later on, in "The One with the Holiday Armadillo", the apartment is fixed and Phoebe and Rachel decide to move back but the repair work left them with only one bedroom, so Phoebe lives there alone while Rachel is living with Joey.
</p><p>In an early episode, Phoebe and Rachel go to get tattoos together. Though Rachel ends up getting a heart tattooed on her hip, Phoebe does not get the intended lily (for her mother) on her shoulder because she didn't know they did it with needles. Rachel tried to convince her to get the tattoo, but the artist barely touched her with the needle before she ran off screaming. She now has a 'blue freckle' which she claims is 'the earth as seen from a great great distance or as (her) mother sees it from heaven'.
</p><p>Phoebe and Rachel have a very strong relationship throughout the series, despite occasional and humorous squabbles over things like jogging, massages, Pottery Barn furniture and a lesbian encounter Rachel had in college (which Phoebe refused to believe, even though it turned out to be true). Like with Monica, Rachel and Phoebe have kissed (screen).

<p>Joey and Rachel first meet at Central Perk, after Rachel leaves Barry at the altar. They become close friends. Later, in the series, Joey falls in love with her, but she does not feel the same way. Even later in the series, Rachel does feel something for Joey, but the past issue is long forgotten. They share a week long, but passionate, relationship. However, they cannot get past the kissing stage, as they know they are just friends, and that's all they ever will be.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chandler_Bing">Chandler Bing </span></h3>
<p>Rachel and Chandler met in the 1980s when she was introduced to him through Ross. Their first meeting was at a Thanksgiving celebration at the home. The pair met again at a party at Ross and Chandler's college in the winter of 1987 ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_The_Stripper_Cries" title="The One Where The Stripper Cries">The One Where The Stripper Cries</a>"). At this party, Chandler and a drunk Rachel shared a kiss. (It was revealed that the only reason Chandler kissed Rachel was to get back at Ross for kissing a girl he liked.)

<p>In 1993, they met again at a bar which would be torn down to make room for the gang's frequent hangout spot Central Perk. Rachel hadn't seen Chandler since her days in high school. At the bar, Chandler overheard Rachel talking to some friends about how she wanted to have one last night of meaningless sex before her marriage to Barry. She added that she wanted to have sex with the first guy she laid her eyes on, which happened to be Chandler. They never did hook up, but Rachel did have a fantasy about him. ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Flashback" title="The One With The Flashback">The One With The Flashback</a>") In another episode, she confesses to having recurrent erotic dreams about him, much to Ross's chagrin.
</p><p>Rachel and Chandler cross paths again in 1994, when Rachel storms into Central Perk looking for Monica. Through the course of the series, Rachel and Chandler's relationship grows. They share a close friendship, often consoling and confiding in one another. On one particular occasion, they share a stolen cheesecake with each other and conceal it from the others. Particularly in earlier seasons, they go out to lunch together a few times. However, there has not been any romance between them, as they are just good friends.

<p>Rachel has been involved in a turbulent,off relationship with Monica's brother, Ross.
After an argument over Rachel's prioritizing work over their anniversary and continued friendship with Mark, Rachel announces that they are taking, "a break." Ross, thinking that Rachel is ending the relationship, gets drunk and sleeps with <a href="/wiki/Chloe" title="Chloe">Chloe</a>. When Rachel decides that she wants to make things work with Ross, he becomes determined to prevent her from finding out about his one-night stand. Rachel eventually finds out about Ross's indiscretion, and the pair argue in Rachel's living room while their friends are trapped in Monica's bedroom. Rachel ends the relationship, and the two bicker for a long while.
</p><p>When Ross decides to marry his British girlfriend, <a href="/wiki/Emily_Waltham" title="Emily Waltham">Emily Waltham</a>, Rachel realizes that she's still in love with him despite the fact that she's involved with someone else. Rachel flies to London to tell Ross how she feels, only to change her mind when she sees how happy Emily makes him. The wedding is ruined, however, when Ross accidentally says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during the wedding vows. Despite the fact that Ross is desperately trying to convince his new wife to forgive him, Rachel tells him that she is still in love with him. They decide to pretend that her declaration of love never happened, due to her embarrassment and his marriage to Emily. The marriage eventually fails due to Emily's inability to trust Ross after the, <i>"I, Ross, take thee Rachel,"</i> incident.
</p><p>On a trip to Vegas, Ross and Rachel got married after a drinking binge. Ross wanted to eat a ton of grapes and Rachel wanted to get married, so they decided to get married then eat a ton of grapes. Unable to get an annulment, they had to divorce instead. Years later, Rachel and Ross slept together. This encounter resulted in a pregnancy, and Rachel gave birth to a daughter: Emma. For a time, they decided to remain friends and roommates. Eventually, they reunited for good when they realized they still loved each other.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Emma_Geller-Green">Emma Geller-Green</span></h3>
<p>Emma is Ross and Rachel's daughter, who was conceived during an encounter in Rachel's apartment, a month before Monica and Chandler's wedding. The name Emma was originally chosen by Monica as the name she wanted to use for her future daughter. Before deciding on Emma, Ross and Rachel discussed several other names: Delilah was rejected because Rachel felt that it made her daughter sound like a Biblical whore, and Isabella was rejected as well. Ross also once stated that he would like to name his daughter Emily, which he soon decided against, possibly because of his marriage to Emily Waltham.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sandra_and_Leonard_Green">Sandra and Leonard Green</span></h3>
<p>Rachel's mother, <a href="/wiki/Sandra_Green" title="Sandra Green">Sandra</a>, has a way of being dominating and unpleasant without going overboard. She's also harsh when it comes to her opinions. (Example: She has suggested moving into Ross's apartment after Emma's birth, and she has added that his "dinosaur things" belong in the garbage.) It is implied that Rachel used to be like her mother before she turned her life around and moved to the city. She managed to avoid a loveless marriage, while her mother married, "her Barry." During her first visit to Rachel's NYC apartment, Mrs. Green admits that she wants a life that is similar to her daughter's.
</p><p>Rachel's father, <a href="/wiki/Leonard_Green" title="Leonard Green">Leonard Green</a>, is a very dominating, strict and harsh man. He has a striking sense of sarcasm and what he deems right or wrong, but he's not afraid of spoiling his daughters. (Rachel claims that her father bought her her own boat to cheer her up when her pony fell ill.) When his daughters do something that he doesn't like, he has the tendency to cut them off financially. Despite being quite generous when it comes to his daughters, he shares very little of his wealth with others. This is proven when he leaves a 2% tip after going out to eat with Rachel and Ross.
</p><p>During their marriage, Rachel's parents' love life was practically non-existent. In fact, they married for the sake of money. According to Rachel, they barely spoke during their marriage ... except when they argued. After their divorce, they could not stand to be in the same room as each other. This led to Rachel's friends throwing her two birthday parties at the same time: one with Rachel's mother in Rachel's apartment, and the other with Rachel's father in the guys' apartment.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Jill_and_Amy_Green">Jill and Amy Green</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jill_Green" title="Jill Green">Jill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amy_Green" title="Amy Green">Amy</a> are Rachel's sisters, with whom she has a typical sibling-rivalry relationship. When they were younger, they would constantly pull pranks on each other.
</p><p>Jill is Rachel's favorite sister, despite being extremely spoiled. During her visit when their father decides to financially cut her off, Jill scoffs at the idea of dating Ross. She changes her mind when she think that Rachel wants her to date him. After two dates, their relationship is ended by Ross, because he doesn't want anything to interfere with his ability to reunite with Rachel. Angry, she sets out to seduce him, after failing to do so, she leaves upset with her sister and says Ross is gay for not wanting to sleep with her.
</p><p>Unlike Jill, Amy doesn't even recognize Ross. In fact, she is convinced that he's a falafel seller. During Thanksgiving dinner, Phoebe says that Amy is the one that bit Rachel. Rachel and Amy don't have a close relationship, like the one Rachel and Jill have. When Amy visits during Emma's first Thanksgiving, she only says, "Hi." Then she announces that she wants to borrow a hair straightener, referring to Emma as "Emmett" because she is under the impression that the baby is a boy.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ida_Green">Ida Green</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ida_Green" title="Ida Green">Ida</a> is Rachel's grandmother, who is referred to by some as "Spuds." When Rachel finds out that some cute guys live in her grandmother's building, she says, <i>"No sense of personal space? Kinda smells like chicken? Looks like a potato? That's my bubbe!" </i>(This is another indication that Rachel is of Jewish descent, as the word "bubbe" means "grandmother" in Yiddish.)

Phoebe said before moving to Joey's "You can stay at Monica's, I'm the one that caused the fire with my stress-release candles." However, an inspector came and found out that it was Rachel's hair straighter that caused the fire, and the living arrangements switched. Rachel moved in with Joey and started to enjoy the more relaxed atmosphere, where it was ok to drop food on the rug and have an afternoon of throwing wet paper towels at the wall.
</p><p>Rachel lived with Joey until and during some of her pregnancy, when Ross felt left out that Joey knew more about Rachel's needs and milestones than he did. Joey suggested that it would be better for Rachel to move in with Ross, because as the father, Ross should be more involved in the experience. Rachel lived with Ross for a few months after Emma was born but after arguing with him and her kissing her colleague on Monica and Chandler's balcony, she moved back in with Joey.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Age_and_birthday">Age and birthday</span></h2>
<p>Although Rachel's age is treated inconsistently by the show's writers, like all birthdays, the best evidence is that she was born on May 5, 1970 or 1971.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Month_and_Day">Month and Day</span></h3>
<p>In "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Joey%27s_New_Girlfriend" title="The One With Joey's New Girlfriend">The One With Joey's New Girlfriend</a>," Rachel tells Gunther her birthday is May 5. This is consistent with the month of birthday parties thrown for her on the show.
</p>
<ul><li>The party in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Rachel_Finds_Out" title="The One Where Rachel Finds Out">The One Where Rachel Finds Out</a>," which aired in May, 1995.
</li><li>Season five's month-early surprise party in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Rachel_Smokes" title="The One Where Rachel Smokes">The One Where Rachel Smokes</a>," which aired in April 1999.
</li></ul>
<p>Rachel's 30th birthday, however, is celebrated in February in season seven's "<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_They_All_Turn_Thirty" title="The One Where They All Turn Thirty">The One Where They All Turn Thirty</a>," which aired on February 8, 2001. (There is no question that the party is on the birthday itself: Rachel, at one point, says, "In Guam, I'm still 29".) Rachel also mentions that her birthday is after Valentine's Day in, "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Girl_From_Poughkeepsie" title="The One With The Girl From Poughkeepsie">The One With The Girl From Poughkeepsie</a>" (<i>"Next thing you know, it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then ... Bang! They're lighting that damned tree again."</i>) A birthday in February is also consistent with Rachel's statement to a police officer in season seven that she is an Aquarius (Jan. 21-Feb. 19). May 5 would make her a Taurus. The February date might be a reference to Jennifer Aniston's real-life birthday, February 11.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Year_of_Birth">Year of Birth</span></h3>
<p>A 30th birthday in 2001 (season seven's "<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_They_All_Turn_Thirty" title="The One Where They All Turn Thirty">The One Where They All Turn Thirty</a>") implies that Rachel was born in 1971. Her 30th birthday is celebrated as the last, while the 30th birthdays of the others are shown in the flashbacks. This makes her the youngest of all six. However, a 29th birthday in 1999 (season five's "<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Rachel_Smokes" title="The One Where Rachel Smokes">The One Where Rachel Smokes</a>") implies that she was born in 1970. In other episodes, Rachel's stated age is inconsistent with birth in either 1971, and advances at varying speeds. Chandler refers to her as 28 in season three's "<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Rachel_Quits" title="The One Where Rachel Quits">The One Where Rachel Quits</a>" (December 12, 1996), but 15 months later Rachel describes herself as "a 28-year old cheerleader with a fat lip" in season four's "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Fake_Party" title="The One With The Fake Party">The One With The Fake Party</a>" (March 19, 1998). While these differences appear as inconsistencies, it may be in keeping with Rachel's character to shield her actual age.
</p><p>Technically, this is how Rachel's age should have gone during the series; 1 (24-25), 2 (25-26), 3 (26-27), 4 (27-28), 5 (28-29), 6 (29-30), 7 (30-31), 8 (31-32), 9 (32-33), 10 (33-34).

They kissed in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Flashback" title="The One With The Flashback">The One With The Flashback</a>" but it was in Rachel's fantasy, so is non-canon.
</li><li><b>Joey</b> -<b> </b>in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_All_The_Resolutions" title="The One With All The Resolutions">The One With All The Resolutions</a> ", "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Rachel%27s_Dream" title="The One With Rachel's Dream">The One With Rachel's Dream</a>", "<a href="/wiki/The_One_In_Barbados,_Part_2" title="The One In Barbados, Part 2">The One In Barbados, Part 2</a>", "<a href="/wiki/The_One_After_Joey_And_Rachel_Kiss" title="The One After Joey And Rachel Kiss">The One After Joey And Rachel Kiss</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Ross%27s_Tan" title="The One With Ross's Tan" class="mw-redirect">The One With Ross's Tan</a>"
</li><li><b>Monica</b> - in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_All_The_Haste" title="The One With All The Haste">The One With All The Haste</a>" to to get their apartment back from Joey and Chandler they had to kiss for one minute (though this was off screen)
</li><li><b>Phoebe </b>- in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Rachel%27s_Big_Kiss" title="The One With Rachel's Big Kiss">The One With Rachel's Big Kiss</a>"
</li></ul>
</li><li>One of Rachel's trademark expressions when shocked or angry is to drag out the enunciation of the word, No, usually with deep inflection. This was periodically paired with Monica's, "I KNOW!"
</li><li>Rachel is the only Friend to have lived in all 4 of the main apartments (Monica's, Joey's, Ross's, and Phoebe's). She is also the only member of the gang to have not lived alone at any point, and has at some point lived full-time with all the Friends except for Chandler.
</li><li>Two of Jennifer Aniston's real-life boyfriends portrayed characters on the show: Tate Donovan as Rachel's boyfriend Joshua Bergin during the fourth season (from "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Rachel%27s_Crush" title="The One With Rachel's Crush">The One With Rachel's Crush</a>" to "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_All_The_Wedding_Dresses" title="The One With All The Wedding Dresses">The One With All The Wedding Dresses</a>"), and Brad Pitt as Will Colbert, a high school classmate whose intense hatred for Rachel was revealed when he came to Thanksgiving dinner in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Rumor" title="The One With The Rumor">The One With The Rumor</a>" (Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston were actually married by the time the episode aired).
</li><li>In <a href="/wiki/Season_2" title="Season 2">Season 2</a>, Rachel gets a tattoo of a red heart on her hip.
</li><li> Rachel's birthday is the most often celebrated in the series, having being celebrated 5 times throughout the entire series.
</li><li>Rachel is the only female of the group who has carried her <i>own</i> child. She is also the only one who never intended on getting pregnant.
</li><li>She is the only one in the group to never propose; this, however, is debatable because she admits to Ross that it was her idea for them to get married in Vegas.
</li><li> She is also the only female in the group and one of the only two in the whole group (next to Joey) to not have an on-screen wedding. Her wedding in Vegas with Ross isn't shown, it only shows them leaving the chapel.
</li><li>It is revealed in <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Phoebe%27s_Cookies" title="The One With Phoebe's Cookies">The One With Phoebe's Cookies</a> that Rachel's father gave Rachel her own boat when she was fifteen, apparently because Rachel's pony was sick.
</li><li>Rachel revealed that she used to have a boyfriend who got stolen away by her sister Amy. She herself once stole Monica's crush.
</li><li>Rachel revealed that she loved her father and even bought him a hair trimmer. However, he threw it away.
</li><li>In Season 4 Episode 21 ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Invitation" title="The One With The Invitation">The One With The Invitation</a>") on Rachel's invite to Ross's wedding, the name at the top is <b>Rachel Greene</b> (with an extra <b>e</b> at the end). Her name can be spelled both ways. Her name is also spelled with the <b>e</b> on her Ralph Lauren nameplate, noticeable in Season 9 Episode 12 ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Phoebe%27s_Rats" title="The One With Phoebe's Rats">The One With Phoebe's Rats</a>") and on Emma's birth certificate.
</li><li>She's scared of turtles as it was informed in "The One With All The Jealousy"
</li><li>There are a few instances in which kinks are hinted at. In "The One With Phoebe's Uterus" it is hinted that she might have a foot fetish, as Monica is talking about erogenous zones, and Rachel adds, "Toes." When everyone looks at her, she says, "You know... for some people." In "The One With the Chicken Pox" it is hinted that she might also have a thing for guys in uniforms when she asks Ross to don one, and then again in "The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy", before inquiring about Ross' fantasies.
</li><li>Her zodiac sign is very inconsistent, her birthday, May 5th, implies that she is a Taurus, however in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Chandler%27s_Dad" title="The One With Chandler's Dad">The One With Chandler's Dad</a>", when she was being pulled over the police officer noted that she was an Aquarius, this might be due to the fact that actress who plays as Rachel, Jennifer Aniston is an Aquarius herself.
