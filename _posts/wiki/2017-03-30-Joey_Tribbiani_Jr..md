<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Character">Character</span></h2>
<p>Joey comes from an Italian-American family of 8 children, of which he is the only male. He is from, and presumably born in, Queens. As a child, he was extremely accident prone. He had an imaginary friend named Maurice, who was a space cowboy. He meets most of the friends (with the exception of Rachel) as a result of becoming Chandler's roommate. He meets Rachel a while later, at Central Perk when she runs out on her wedding.
</p><p>Joey is a stereotypical actor: oversexed, under-educated, and constantly looking for work. He is also ordained as a minister in, "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Truth_About_London" title="The One With The Truth About London">The One With The Truth About London</a>", and he officiates at both Monica and Chandler's and Phoebe and Mike's weddings. It is revealed in, "<a href="/wiki/The_One_After_%27I_Do%27" title="The One After 'I Do'">The One After 'I Do'</a>" that Joey has a size seven foot, which he is secretive and defensive about. He also has a soft toy penguin named <a href="/wiki/Huggsy" title="Huggsy">Huggsy</a> (his "bedtime penguin pal"), which he is very fond of and does not like to share. In, "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Ross_and_Monica%27s_Cousin" title="The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin" class="mw-redirect">The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin</a>", it is revealed that Joey is circumcised.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Joey is generally good-natured and well-meaning, but not-so-bright. He loves food, women, sex, family, friends, jam, and the New York Knicks.
</p><p>Joey is known for his love of food and sex. He particularly loves sandwiches and pizza. In <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Ross%27s_Wedding,_Part_2" title="The One With Ross's Wedding, Part 2">The One With Ross's Wedding, Part 2</a>, it is mentioned that the "Joey Special" is two pizzas. Also, in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Ride_Along" title="The One With The Ride Along" class="mw-redirect">The One With The Ride Along</a>," he appears to be saving Ross from a supposed gunshot. But in reality, it is his meatball sandwich that he is trying to protect; it just happens to be near Ross. Joey also doesn't share food, even with a date, as shown in <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Birth_Mother" title="The One With The Birth Mother">The One With The Birth Mother</a>.
</p><p>He has a lot of trouble with understanding negative criticism of his acting. Also, although he is usually simple-minded, there are moments where he seems very smart. He discovers Chandler and Monica slept with each other when he hears Monica lost her eyelash-curler, and immediately remembers Chandler saying that the girl he slept with had lost her eyelash-curler.
</p><p>The character was originally not supposed to be anything like he is portrayed throughout most of the series. His original character description mentions him as "macho, smug, loves women and most of all Joey" which is how we see him for the first two seasons. It was Matt LeBlanc's idea to make a dim character.
</p><p>Joey's simple-mindedness and lack of common sense are demonstrated when Chandler's traumatizing experience at Joey's childhood tailor finally wake him up to the fact that his tailor has been taking advantage of him and his family for 16 years.
</p><p>It can be argued that he is the most promiscuous of the group. He has sex with a variety of women, and quite often will sleep with a woman and never call them again. He has been known to even take shots at and flirt with his female friends. He has actually kissed all of them, and he even dates Rachel for a time. He also frequently imagines lesbian scenes in his head, such as when Rachel tells Monica that they're going out with two nurses. Joey believes that she means female nurses, and seems pleased with the thought.
</p><p>He is something of an idiot savant in matters of romance, and his popular catchphrase/pickup line is, <i>"How you doin'?"</i> This is directly alluded to when Chandler says, <i>"A hot girl's at stake, and suddenly [Joey is] Rain Man"</i> after he quickly comes up with an idea for how Ross could find out which of his students referred to him as the 'hottie of the paleontology department' in the end-of-year evaluation. Joey has made up an anecdote referred to as the "Europe story," or the "magic story", after which hearing it the listener will immediately want to have sex with the storyteller. When Rachel points out that she heard that a man named Ken Adams came up with the story, he confesses that he is, in fact, Ken Adams.

<p>In contrast to his "ladies man" personality, he has also a marked childish side. He enjoys playing videogames and foosball, "exclusively" reads comics ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Halloween_Party" title="The One With The Halloween Party">The One With The Halloween Party</a>"), and is often seen having fun with whatever is around; like a hockey puck ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_George_Stephanopoulos" title="The One With George Stephanopoulos">The One With George Stephanopoulos</a>"), a scooter ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_They_All_Turn_Thirty" title="The One Where They All Turn Thirty">The One Where They All Turn Thirty</a>"), a pile of boxes ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Ross_Moves_In" title="The One Where Ross Moves In">The One Where Ross Moves In</a>"), bubble wrap ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Rachel%27s_Going_Away_Party" title="The One With Rachel's Going Away Party">The One With Rachel's Going Away Party</a>") or jumping on the bed ("<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Jam" title="The One With The Jam">The One With The Jam</a>"); among many other examples. He even sleeps with a soft toy penguin named <a href="/wiki/Huggsy" title="Huggsy">Huggsy</a> and has a Cabbage Patch Kid which he named <a href="/wiki/Alicia_May_Emory" title="Alicia May Emory">Alicia May Emory</a>.
</p><p>This childishness often leads to a running gag where he is actually treated like a infant. In <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Rachel%27s_Other_Sister" title="The One With Rachel's Other Sister">The One With Rachel's Other Sister</a>, after Ross says Chandler wouldn't get Emma if Ross and Rachel die, Chandler says none of them would get Joey. After they clear things up, Chandler says they can get him, but warns Ross that "he [Joey] eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose". In <a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Rachel%27s_Sister_Baby-Sits" title="The One Where Rachel's Sister Baby-Sits">The One Where Rachel's Sister Baby-Sits</a>, Joey writes a recommendation letter for Chandler and Monica and sends it to an adoption agency, who mistakenly believe it had been written by a child. They "guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings", and call Joey in return, asking for his "mommy and daddy". In <a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Monica_And_Richard_Are_Friends" title="The One Where Monica And Richard Are Friends">The One Where Monica And Richard Are Friends</a>, Joey puts <i>The Shining</i> and <i>Little Women</i> in the freezer after he is too scared or sad to keep reading them, and Rachel has to comfort him and lie to him about the death of a character he liked. In <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Princess_Consuela" title="The One With Princess Consuela">The One With Princess Consuela</a>, Joey and 8-year old girl <a href="/wiki/Mackenzie" title="Mackenzie">Mackenzie</a> try to prevent Chandler and Monica from buying a house, and Joey suggests telling them the house is haunted, to which Mackenzie responds "What are you? Eight?". He later calls her asking for an unrelated advice, but she redirects him to her stuffed bear, and Joey effectively keeps talking to the toy.
</p><p>Despite generally being ignorant in most academic fields, he purchases a single encyclopedia in <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Cuffs" title="The One With The Cuffs">The One With The Cuffs</a>. This ends up making him knowledgeable about any topic that begins with the letter "V", specifically vomit, Mount Vesuvius, volcanoes, vivisection, the vas deferens, and the Vietnam War.

Monica’s and Ross’ long time crush, enters Central Perk wearing a wedding dress. Rachel explains that she is wearing the dress because she was supposed
to get married but decided against it because she noticed that her fiancé looked like Mr. Potato Head. When the group returns to Monica’s apartment they

<p>Chandler is Joey's best friend. Joey meets Chandler when he shows up at the apartment for a roommate interview. He is initially shunned by Chandler when he incorrectly assumes that he is gay. <a href="/wiki/Mr_Heckles" title="Mr Heckles" class="mw-redirect">Mr Heckles</a> interferes with Chandler's originally selected roommate, which means that Joey becomes Chandler's new roommate.

A long-running gag depicts Joey and Chandler occasionally fighting with each other like an old married couple, with Chandler often assuming the wife role while Joey assumes the husband role. This ends when Chandler becomes involved with Monica. When Chandler moves out, Joey tears up. Joey moves out for a while when he finds success as <a href="/wiki/Dr._Drake_Ramoray" title="Dr. Drake Ramoray" class="mw-redirect">Dr. Drake Ramoray</a> on "Days of Our Lives", but moves in again when he loses his job. He and Chandler remain roommates until Chandler moves in with Monica. When Chandler and Monica have trouble finding a minister to officiate at their wedding, Joey becomes ordained so he can perform the ceremony himself.              
He calls Chandler moments after suspecting Monica of having an affair with a mystery male he hears in her apartment, not knowing that the "mystery male" is Chandler himself. He is also the only one that knew that Chandler is afraid of dogs.

<p>Joey and Monica meet when Joey leaves the roommate interview, and they are instantly attracted to each other. Monica invites Joey in for some lemonade, which Joey misinterprets as an invitation to have sex with her. While Monica has her back turned to him, Joey strips naked. Monica turns around and is startled by what she sees, insisting that she was not offering to have sex with him. At some point, their mutual attraction dies down and they settle for being good friends.  However, a depressed Monica in London seeks out Joey for a one night stand to cheer herself up, but cannot find him, and they occasionally flirt, but this mostly is initiated by Joey.  In one episode, Monica tells Joey that she needs a favor, to which he responds, "I can't say that it isn't something I've thought about, but it would be wrong...<i>good [wink]</i>, but wrong."  Monica, who was going to ask for money, replies, "First of all, it would be<i> great</i>..."  Joey stood in for the un-photogenic Chandler in their wedding announcement for the paper, and Monica, pleased by how good they look together, wonders what their kids would look like. Joey has also seen Monica topless in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Boobies" title="The One With The Boobies">The One With The Boobies</a>".
</p><p>When Monica is bullied by the staff at Alessandro's, Joey allows her to hire him and then fire him so she can prove to her employees that she is not a push-over.              
When he discovers Chandler and Monica's relationship, he agrees to keep it a secret until they were ready to tell the others about their romance. His sense of obligation to the couple often resulted in him being involved in embarrassing situations.

<p>Joey meets Phoebe at the bar that will eventually become Central Perk, shortly after he becomes Chandler's roommate. They seem to be on the same wavelength, partially due to their being the only members of the group who lack a college education. Joey is Phoebe's best male friend, and they have dinner once a month to talk about the rest of the group.
</p><p>When Joey decides to learn how to play the guitar as his New Year's resolution, it is Phoebe who decides to teach him. He becomes fed up with her when she forbids him to touch a guitar until she feels that he's ready, and they have a brief falling out when he hires a professional guitar teacher. Phoebe also tries to teach him how to speak French, as he has claimed to be fluent in the language. Much to Phoebe's annoyance, Joey has no aptitude for foreign language and speaks gibberish. When they realize that the group may have to split up because Emily has forbidden Ross from being friends with Rachel, Phoebe and Rachel conspire to form a separate group by themselves. Phoebe insists that Joey come to their new group. Her loyalty is proven again when she states that she could live in Las Vegas, since it has everything she needs, "Including Joey!" He, in turn, invites her to live with him in the mansion he expects to own when he becomes rich from having a hand twin. Phoebe once says to her friends, <i>"When the Revolution comes, I'll have to kill you all." </i>After a moment's pause, she adds, <i>"Not you, Joey."</i>
</p><p>For a time, Phoebe seems to have a crush on Joey. She becomes jealous of his relationship with her twin sister, Ursula, especially when Joey sleeps with Ursula instead of choosing to attend Phoebe's surprise birthday party. Phoebe and Joey's relationship never progresses beyond a few kisses. When Phoebe realizes that she is 31 and not 30, she laments all the things she has failed to do before turning 31 - including having the perfect kiss and meeting Portuguese people. To make her feel better, Joey gives her a kiss and says, <i>"Oh. I'm 1/16 Portuguese."</i>.
</p><p><b>Friendships in general</b>
</p><p>The girls have been the objects of many sexist comments on Joey's behalf, especially Monica. Chandler once sarcastically puts it, <i>"Your long-standing offer to have sex with my wife is much appreciated." </i>Not withstanding this apparent boorishness, he's always enjoyed a close relationship with Monica,  According to Matt LeBlanc, Joey sees the girls as sisters more than potential romantic interests.
</p><p>A good example of the strong affection all five of his fellow friends have for Joey occurs immediately after they find out that his <i>Days of Our Lives</i> character has been killed off. When he doesn't answer his phone, they rush over to his apartment to check on him. Rachel tries to cheer him up by assuring him that as far as all of them are concerned, he will always be a great actor.

</p><p>Alex is Joey's super in the Friends spin-off Joey. She later becomes his girlfriend, and she is the first girl Joey has thought about marrying.
</p><p><b>Women</b>
</p><p>Joey is very promiscuous. When Chandler asks Joey if he's had a lot of sex, Joey says, <i>"Today? Some. Not a lot." </i>He sleeps with many of the interns and extras on shows that he works on. He has apparently been sexually active for a very long time. He undid a 16-year-old girl's bra when he was 9-years-old; he slept with his teacher in the seventh grade; and he had a wild spring break when he was thirteen.
</p><p>Despite his great interest in women, he has shown more than once that he will put friends over lovers if faced with a choice: when <a href="/wiki/Janine_Lecroix" title="Janine Lecroix">Janine Lecroix</a> revealed that she disliked Monica and Chandler, Joey quickly broke off his relationship with her despite having been interested in her for the last few episodes; and when Phoebe impersonated her twin sister Ursula (who Joey had been dating) and made him decide between his relationship with Ursula and his friendship with Phoebe, Joey chose Phoebe without hesitation. 
At the end of the series, Joey is the only friend that ends up without a lover or a spouse, even though he is the one who has dated the most.

<p>Joey's most famous acting role is as <a href="/wiki/Dr._Drake_Ramoray" title="Dr. Drake Ramoray" class="mw-redirect">Dr. Drake Ramoray</a> on the serial drama <i><a href="/wiki/Days_of_Our_Lives" title="Days of Our Lives" class="mw-redirect">Days of Our Lives</a></i>. When he claims in an interview that he writes many of his own lines, the writers of the show become annoyed and kill off his character. After blowing his opportunity to be cast as Dr. Ramoray's twin brother, Striker, Joey returns to <i>Days of Our Lives</i> in a bizarre plot twist which resurrects Dr. Ramoray. The plot line that brings Dr. Ramoray back is never fully explained, except that a female character's brain is transplanted into Ramoray's body. This effectively forces Joey to play a woman with a dominant personality. Other characters refer to the character as Drake, while still alluding to the fact that he has the female character's brain. Following this, he appears to completely be Drake again. In <a href="/wiki/Season_7" title="Season 7">season 7</a>, Joey is up for a Soapie for Best Returning Male Character. He loses, so he tries to steal an award from a female co-star who can't be there to receive the award.

<p>Joey's other roles include: A spot in a Japanese commercial for Lipstick For Men; an infomercial for a device that makes it easier to pour milk out of cartons; a leading role in the World War I period film <i>Over There</i>; and a starring role in a short-lived cop show called <i><a href="/wiki/Mac_and_C.H.E.E.S.E." title="Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.">Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.</a></i> In terms of stage work, he has appeared in a play called <i>Boxing Day</i>, in which his character goes to outer space. He has also been in a production of <i>Macbeth. </i>He played the title role in <i>Freud!</i>, as well as auditioning for Mercutio in <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i> under the pseudonym Holden McGroin.
</p><p>Joey is up for a starring role in a film in which he has to play a Catholic immigrant. The film calls for a nude scene, and the casting director requires an actor who is uncircumcised. Joey and Monica frantically try to artificially create a foreskin using luncheon meats. All seems to go well until Joey strips nude at the casting call and his "foreskin" falls off, prompting him to say, <i>"Well, that's never happened before."</i>
</p><p>In addition to the quick cancellation of <i>Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.</i>, Joey also has some other remarkably bad luck in terms of his acting career. He films an episode of <i>Law &amp; Order</i> and is horrified when he finds that he's been cut from the completed episode; he is only seen as a corpse in a body bag. He is also cast in the independent film <i>Shutter Speed</i>, but it is shut down before filming begins. Also, he is fired from a Burger King commercial.
</p><p>However, his acting career has had some better moments. In <i>Joey</i>, it is revealed that Dr. Drake Ramoray is dead after a nurse stabbed him while he was operating on her husband. He wins a Daytime Soap Award for Best Death Scene. Joey lands a starring role on the prime time soap <i>Deep Powder</i>. When he is fired, he almost immediately bounces back by snagging a leading role in the big-budget action picture <i>Captured</i>.
</p><p>Joey briefly mentions to the gang that Al Pacino is his idol. He has the poster for the 1983 Al Pacino film <i>Scarface</i>. He is excited, but embarrassed, when he is cast as Pacino's butt double in <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Butt" title="The One With The Butt">The One With The Butt</a>. However, he loses the role when he "acts too much".

At first, Joey tries to hide this fact from his friends. But they eventually figure it out, anyway. He does not like the work. But, true to his nature, he soon finds a way to use his position to meet and ingratiate himself to attractive women by giving them free food. He doesn't take his job very seriously, and he spends a lot of his working hours sitting and talking to his friends. Gunther fires Joey, who closes the coffee house in the middle of the day to go to an audition. Rachel is angered that Gunther had left just so that he could dye his hair, leaving new employee Joey in charge. Rachel easily persuades Gunther, who is in love with her, to give Joey back his job.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Age">Age</span></h2>
<p>Joey's age is not consistently treated. It is first mentioned in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Birth" title="The One With The Birth">The One With The Birth</a>" which aired in May 1995 in which he says he is 25, which would made him born around 1969-1970 and would even make him younger than Monica (who claims being 26 just an episode before in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Ick_Factor" title="The One With The Ick Factor">The One With The Ick Factor</a>"). But, a little less than a year later in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Joey_Moves_Out" title="The One Where Joey Moves Out">The One Where Joey Moves Out</a>", which aired in February, 1996, Joey says he is 28. The latter would put his birth in 1967 or early 1968, which would makes him then to be older than Chandler.
Joey says he has been acting for 10 years. This is consistent with birth in 1967 or 1968, assuming he began his acting career at about age 18.
</p><p>In "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Joey%27s_Fridge" title="The One With Joey's Fridge">The One With Joey's Fridge</a>", he refers to his activities during spring break in 1981 and Monica comments, <i>"You were thirteen."</i> On the contrary, the possibility of him being born in 1969-1970 is referred to again in Season 3. Indeed, in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Jam" title="The One With The Jam">The One With The Jam</a>", when Monica is reading a list of sperm donors, she sees Joey is among them and it is written here that he is <i>"27"</i>. But when Joey tells his friends that he's supposed to play a 19-year-old, Chandler comments, <i>"So by 'get up early', do you mean 1986?"</i>which is inconsistent with his birth in 1969.
</p><p>Due to the age at the end, this is how the ages should have gone: 1 (25-26), 2 (26-27), 3 (27-28), 4 (28-29), 5 (29-30), 6 (30-31), 7 (31-32), 8 (32-33), 9 (33-34), 10 (34-35).         
Joey's birthday is then consistent with what <a href="/wiki/Michael_Tribbiani" title="Michael Tribbiani">Michael</a> reveals in the first season of Joey, where he said to be 35. This results in a 35-36 age for <a href="/wiki/Joey_Season_1" title="Joey Season 1">season 1</a> and 36-37 for <a href="/wiki/Joey_Season_2" title="Joey Season 2">season 2</a>.
