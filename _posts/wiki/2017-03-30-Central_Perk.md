<p>Rachel works as a waitress at Central Perk from <a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Monica_Gets_A_Roommate" title="The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate" class="mw-redirect">autumn 1994</a> till <a href="/wiki/The_One_Where_Rachel_Quits" title="The One Where Rachel Quits">winter 1996/1997</a>. Being pretty much a spoiled, self-centered individual throughout this period of her life, Rachel clearly shows ineptitude at work, mixing up orders, neglecting her waitressing duties, and showing little care about where everything goes and how it should be done. Ironically, in <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Flashback" title="The One With The Flashback">The One With The Flashback</a>, it is revealed that prior to getting this job, while out with her friends one night, she had responded to a waiter getting their drinks mixed up by remarking: "how hard is it to get a couple of drinks?". When Joey <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Joke" title="The One With The Joke">starts working</a> at Central Perk, Rachel mentions that she would sneeze on the food of any customers who were rude to her.
</p><p>It quickly becomes clear that Rachel does not care for her job at Central Perk, only for her financial income. However, she does try for other job opportunities in fashion (mostly during <a href="/wiki/Season_1" title="Season 1">Season 1</a>), with little success. In <a href="/wiki/Season_3" title="Season 3">Season 3</a>, she decides to pursue the fashion business again after Gunther assigns her to re-training, quitting her waitressing job to work with Fortunata Fashions, then moving on to Bloomingdale's.

</p><p>Joey becomes a waiter at the coffee shop <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Joke" title="The One With The Joke">half-way</a> through <a href="/wiki/Season_6" title="Season 6">Season 6</a>. His acting career being at a standstill, Joey is tight on money, so much that he can't afford paying for coffee. Gunther decides to let him work there. Like Rachel, Joey shows ineptitude at the job. Unlike Rachel, however, this is mostly due to his immaturity coinciding with the house's policies. However, later in the season, Joey's acting career takes a step forward when he gets the lead role in <i><a href="/wiki/Mac_%26_C.H.E.E.S.E." title="Mac &amp; C.H.E.E.S.E." class="mw-redirect">Mac &amp; C.H.E.E.S.E.</a></i>. This makes him quit his waitering job, which he does without mentioning anything to Gunther. Gunther, however, points this out to him in <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Ring" title="The One With The Ring">The One With The Ring</a>, and that he was going to fire Joey anyway.

<p>Throughout the coffee shop are small tables with chairs that extras on the show usually occupy. These, from the main camera angle, are behind the large orange sofa in the middle of the shop. The green chair on the right, the coffee table and the table and chair on the left are nearly always used as the main setting for any scenes in Central Perk. In the earlier episodes, irrespective of how busy the coffee shop became, those seats were always available. The writers turned this into a joke and, in <a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Princess_Leia_Fantasy" title="The One With The Princess Leia Fantasy">the first episode of season three</a>, the six main characters arrive in the shop to find their seats taken, apparently by Kevin Bright, Marta Kauffman and David Crane, the show's creators. They then look at each other, dejected, and walk out. The artwork in the back of Central Perk was changed every three episodes (including images of King Kong and Uncle Sam), but the layout of the furniture remained largely unchanged for the entire series.

<p>The most prominent fixture of Central Perk is the large orange couch that the characters usually sit on. It usually seats four of the Friends at one time. One of the others then occupies the green chair on the right and, if all six are present, there is a table with one chair to the left that sits the last person. Rarely is anyone else ever seen on the couch and the guys consider it their own. In one instance, Chandler is seen sitting reading, when a young man comes in and goes to sit down on the green chair, only for Chandler to promptly usher him away. Another example is when Rachel complains about sitting by the window instead of the couch, or when the Friends came in only to see the couch taken, and leave. In <i><a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Bullies" title="The One With The Bullies">The One With The Bullies</a></i> two bullies 'steal' the seating area, and also steal Chandler's hat. In 'The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion', Robin Williams and Billy Crystal come in the coffee house and ask the cast to move over. They are sitting there having a personal conversation, which the cast overhears.
</p><p>The couch is also seen in the opening credits of the show in front of the large fountain the cast of <i>Friends</i> dance in. At the end of the credits all of the friends sit on the couch at once as <a href="/wiki/Monica_Geller" title="Monica Geller" class="mw-redirect">Monica</a> turns off the lamp to the right.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cultural_Impact">Cultural Impact </span></h2>
<p>The Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, has inspired various imitations. In 2006, <a  class="text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran">Iranian</a> businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk <a  class="text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising">franchise</a>, registering the name in 32 countries.
