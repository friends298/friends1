Story: Everyone makes a pact not to bring dates to their New Year's Eve party but everyone breaks the no-date pact except Ross. While performing at Central Perk, Phoebe confronts some noisy scientist guys and ends up dating one of them, David (Hank Azaria), whom she brings to the party. Their relationship develops well until he gets offered a grant to go to Minsk and has to choose whether to stay with her or go for career making research. Monica invites 'Fun' Bobby, but he just lost his grandfather and cries all evening. Joey's date is a single mom, Sandy, whom he met whilst working as an elf in a department store and brings her children to the party, but ends up with David's friend. Rachel plans to bring Paulo who was supposed to fly in earlier than expected, but he misses his flight and Rachel gets into a fight at the airport. Chandler snaps and asks Janice to be his date, but he breaks up with her again. Ross arrives at the party bringing his new companion, a monkey named Marcel, who seems to take no interest in Ross at all. In the end, everyone ends up without a date and fulfilling the pact anyway. When Chandler complains he has no-one to kiss at midnight, Joey does the honors.
