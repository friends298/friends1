<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>After working as a data processing "temp" for the last five years, Chandler is promoted to data processing supervisor. Realizing that by accepting the promotion he acknowledges this as his career, he quits. 
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Phoebe" title="Phoebe" class="mw-redirect">Phoebe</a> mentions a chef vacancy to Chandler, who is now unemployed. Chandler declines, but <a href="/wiki/Monica_Geller-Bing" title="Monica Geller-Bing">Monica</a> is thrilled and intrigued. She invites <a href="/wiki/Steve_(drug_addict)" title="Steve (drug addict)">Steve</a>, the owner, to dinner at <a href="/wiki/Monica%27s_Apartment" title="Monica's Apartment">her apartment</a>, where she cooks a gourmet meal for him. Phoebe comes along to "make yummy noises", while <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Green" title="Rachel Green">Rachel</a> helps Monica by waitressing. Unfortunately, Phoebe points out to Rachel (who points out to Monica) that the guy's stoned. Monica thinks Rachel's kidding until she sees that Steve is far more interested in eating instant mac and cheese, taco shells, and gummy bears than the fancy gourmet menu he's seeking out for his restaurant. Monica calls off the dinner.
</p><p><span>Chandler takes aptitude tests to find out what new career he should pursue, but finds out his ideal career is the one he just quit. When he receives a call from his boss offering a big raise to accompany the promotion, he accepts his new job role. It turns out to be a job that he has to care about, which makes him hate himself.</span>
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Ross" title="Ross" class="mw-redirect">Ross</a> has a date with a beautiful museum colleague, Celia. Things are going well, but she wants him to talk dirty to her, and Ross, caught unawares, stumbles on the word "vulva", which makes him and Celia cuddle instead of having sex. He asks Joey for help, although he's highly uncomfortable about this (especially when Chandler eavesdrops on him and Joey having a rehearsed dirty conversation), but decides to work on it. Unfortunately for him, his new refined seductive art takes too long for him to do anything with Celia, whom he ends up cuddling with again.
</p><p>In revenge for ruining Monica's new job opportunity, Phoebe massages Steve, jabbing him with her elbows up and down his back, causing him to yell in pain.

By this time, Steve has lost his restaurant to drugs, lives in a studio apartment with two guys, and produces custom T-shirt text prints. His ego is pretty much at rock bottom, as he hates practically everything about himself (except for his hair), and often ends up crying, even in front of women. However, he's still keen on his drug ambition - on Rachel's date, in fact, he goes to "blaze a doobie" at least four times.
</li><li>This episode was filmed in front of a live studio audience on December 13, 1994.

<ul><li>When Phoebe goes to tell Rachel about Steve, her purse is on her right arm. When she says that Steve "blazed up a doobie" her purse is now on her left arm, and again switches back to her right.
</li><li>When Steve is rapidly eating the first course Monica serves, he eats everything on the plate, even the red piece of fruit in the middle. When she puts the plate down and the angle changes, the fruit is back on the plate.

<ul><li><b>Chandler</b>: This was supposed to be a temp job.<br /><b>Monica</b>: Chandler, you've been there for five years.<br /><b>Chandler</b>: I know, but if I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I <i>actually</i> do.
