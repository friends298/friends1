Story: The gang searches frantically for Marcel, who slipped out of the apartment
  while Rachel was baby-sitting him. Rachel, who does not know that Marcel is an illegal
  pet, ends up calling Animal Safety. This annoys Ross. The woman who comes to take
  away Marcel turns out to be an old class-mate of Rachel & Monica. After Marcel is
  found and safe, Ross finally gets up the courage to try to woo Rachel. But just
  when it looks like the two might actually spend a romantic evening alone together,
  Barry, Rachel's ex-fiance, barges into the apartment declaring his love for her.
