Story: Monica becomes irritated when everyone likes her new boyfriend Alan, more than she does. Chandler starts smoking again and when the group complains, he diverts their attention to their own faults. Phoebe gets money put into her bank account that isn't hers and when she complains she gets more so she gives it to her homeless friend who buys her a can of soda, only to find a thumb in the can of soda. Phoebe uses the money from the soda company to pay Chandler to quit smoking.
