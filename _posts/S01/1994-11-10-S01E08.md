Story: Ross and Monica go to the bedside of their passed grandmother, who momentarily returns to life. Meanwhile, one of Chandler's colleagues tries to fix him up on a date with a man and Chandler finds out that a lot of people think he's gay when they first meet him and he tries to find out why. The gang goes to Ross and Monica's Nana's funeral, where Monica confronts her mother about her critical attitude. Ross falls into an open grave and hurts his back, resulting in him getting a bit loopy on muscle relaxers.
