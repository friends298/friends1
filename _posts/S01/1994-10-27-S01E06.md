Story: Everyone attends Joey's new musical where Chandler meets a beautiful and exotic Italian woman, Aurora (Sofia Milos), and asks her out. He finds out she is married and already has another boyfriend and is thrilled at the prospect of having "all the fun and none of the responsibility" in this polyamorous relationship. However, when she picks up another he learns that it's not all it's cracked up to be and can't take it. Joey gets picked up at the musical by the 'Estelle Leonard Talent Agency,' which finally gets him a film role as a stand-in for Al Pacino's butt double. However, he loses the job because he overacts. Rachel cleans the apartment by herself for the first time, but she triggers Monica's obsessive tendencies when she moves furniture around.
