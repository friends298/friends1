Story: Rachel leaves her fiance, Barry, at the altar and decides to move in with her
  old friend Monica after meeting the gang in the coffee place 'Central Perk.' Everyone
  watches Spanish soap operas at Monica's place. Monica, meanwhile, sleeps with Paul
  the 'Wine Guy' from her work, who turns out to be less than sincere and lies to
  get her into bed. Chandler and Joey try to get Ross back into dating who is reeling
  from his divorce from Carol as he found out she is a lesbian. Ross reveals his high
  school crush on Rachel and mentions asking her out. Rachel discovers independence
  isn't as easy as she thought and gets a job at the coffee house as a waitress.
