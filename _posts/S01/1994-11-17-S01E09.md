Story: Ross finds out Susan talks to the unborn baby and decides he must too. Monica plans a lovely, quiet Thanksgiving feast for the gang in her apartment because Ross and Monica's parents are away, but her plans go awry. Phoebe joins them because she celebrates Thanksgiving with her grandmother in December. Joey poses for a health poster, but later finds out he's become the V.D. poster boy and so his family thinks he has V.D. and he joins them too. Chandler plans to boycott Thanksgiving because his parents announced their divorce on Thanksgiving when he was younger. The 'Underdog' balloon breaks free during the parade and everyone goes to the roof to watch and get locked out of Monica's apartment meaning the dinner gets burned. Rachel had planned to go skiing in Vail with her family, but misses her flight home and joins them too. Everyone ends up eating Chandler's cheese sandwiches for dinner.
