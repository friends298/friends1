Story: Carol goes into labor, prompting Monica to begin thinking about having a baby
  of her own. Carol is about to give birth to the baby. As Ross and Susan cannot stop
  bickering over who gets to help Carol more, Phoebe drags both of them into a small
  room to settle their differences â€“ but all three end up getting locked in. Rachel
  flirts with an OB/GYN who has a love-hate relationship with women's private parts
  due to seeing them every day at work. Joey ends up assisting birth for a single
  mother (played by Leah Remini). The new born baby is named Ben, derived from the
  janitor's shirt in the small room in which Ross, Susan and Phoebe were locked in.
