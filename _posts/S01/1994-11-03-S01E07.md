Story: During a New York City-wide power outage, while the gang is hanging at Monica and Rachel's apartment, Ross tries to share his loving feelings with Rachel but is attacked by a cat. Rachel and Phoebe begin searching for the cat's owner, but when Mr. Heckles tries to claim the cat he spooks it. The cat turns out to belong to Paolo, a dark, attractive Italian hunk who lives in the building and doesn't speak much English and Rachel falls for him immediately. Meanwhile, Chandler is trapped in an ATM vestibule with 'Victoria's Secret' model Jill Goodacre and he desperately tries to impress her. (This episode was tied to the Mad About You season 3 episode Pandora's Box which depicted the cause of the city-wide blackout.)
