Story: At the hospital, Rachel, who has no health insurance, convinces Monica into trading identities with her so she can use Monica's coverage. The girls end up trying to date two cute doctors (George Clooney & Noah Wyle). Ursula dumps Joey, but plans not to tell him, so Phoebe disguises herself as her twin sister to dump Joey and make sure he does not get hurt. Ross doubts that he will ever feel like a father. Marcel swallows Scrabble tiles and Ross takes care of him making him feel like he would be a good father after that.(A repeat of Seinfeld originally aired between both parts of this two-part episode.)
