Story: Ross, upset about it being the anniversary of his first time sleeping with Carol, goes to a Rangers game with Chandler and Joey and gets hit in the face by a puck, and is taken to the hospital. There, Ross reveals Carol is the only woman he's ever slept with. Rachel gets her first pay check but is angry that most of her money went to FICA, and also gets a visit from her old friends, which depresses her further about her new life. To cheer her up, Monica and Phoebe have a slumber party which isn't very fun due to Rachel's depressed state, until the girls spy on George Stephanopoulos, whose pizza was delivered to them by mistake, across the street.
