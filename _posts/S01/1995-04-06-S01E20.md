<p>Although <a href="/wiki/Barry" title="Barry" class="mw-redirect">Barry</a> is marrying <a href="/wiki/Mindy" title="Mindy" class="mw-redirect">Mindy</a>, he's still in love with <a href="/wiki/Rachel" title="Rachel" class="mw-redirect">Rachel</a>. He goes out on a date with her again, which makes Rachel realize she may not be over him yet. When she tries to break up with him, she ends up having sex with him in his dentist's chair. Later, Mindy calls her to talk to her, and asks her to be her maid of honor, which Rachel accepts. However, Mindy also mentions that she thinks Barry's cheating on her. Rachel tries to assure her that when she and Barry were engaged, she suspected that he was cheating on her. Unfortunately, this is even worse for Mindy, who confesses that she did the exact same thing with Barry at the time, which makes Rachel admit her affair. They then storm over to Barry's office, intending to break up with him. He then defends himself, saying although he loves them both, he loves Mindy most and wants to marry her. When he leaves the office, Mindy tells Rachel she still wants to marry Barry, and Rachel agrees to remain her maid of honor. Later, Rachel admits to Monica that after months of agonizing on whether she made the right decision leaving Barry at the altar, she now knows she did.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Chandler" title="Chandler" class="mw-redirect">Chandler</a> is going nuts about a woman he likes but won't return his phone calls. Although they've only gone out on one date, he's reluctant to show her how needy he is, and tries to play cool over the phone. When she comes over at the coffee house to meet him in person, she explains how she had his number wrong. Although the guys interpret this as a nice gesture, Chandler is unsure about a second date with her, as he thinks it's needy.
</p><p>Meanwhile, a <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Marks" title="Sidney Marks">Sidney Marks</a> is spying on the friends from Ugly Naked Guy's building with a telescope. When <a href="/wiki/Joey" title="Joey" class="mw-redirect">Joey</a> gets the phone number, he discovers that Sidney is a woman. It only takes a few words over the phone for their rage to go away, as they find her compliments charming enough to hold a civil conversation with her.
