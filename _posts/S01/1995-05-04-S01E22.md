<p><b>"The One With The Ick Factor"</b> is the twenty-second episode of the <a href="/wiki/First_season" title="First season" class="mw-redirect">first season</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Friends" title="Friends">Friends</a></i>, which aired on <a href="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> on May 4, 1995.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Monica" title="Monica" class="mw-redirect">Monica</a> is dating <a href="/wiki/Ethan" title="Ethan">Ethan</a> and the relationship seems to be going pretty well. When she tells the gang he's a senior in college, they also find out that she's told Ethan that she's 22 -- a bit more than a white lie considering that Monica is 26. On "the night", Ethan admits that he's a virgin and has been saving himself for the right person. That doesn't deter Monica, though, and the two have sex. Afterwards, Monica feels compelled to admit that she's not really 22. She's relieved when Ethan takes the news well, but her relief soon turns to disgust when Ethan reveals a secret of his own. He's a senior... in highschool.  Ethan contends that the two can continue their relationship even though he's 17, but Monica is having none of it. When Ethan asks her why she's breaking it off she tells him "...it's icky", hence the episode's title.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Phoebe" title="Phoebe" class="mw-redirect">Phoebe</a> temps as <a href="/wiki/Chandler" title="Chandler" class="mw-redirect">Chandler</a>'s secretary, which brings out the fact that his former work colleagues don't like him anymore due to his promotion. Chandler does all he can to fix the situation, but Phoebe makes him see that they will never look at him as a friends because he's their boss now. Phoebe mentions how his former work friends now imitate his odd speaking patterns. Chandler uses this to his advantage to cut some work off his shoulders and tighten project deadlines on his old friends, while also accenting his speaking in order to get a laugh out of them.
</p><p>Rachel has erotic dreams about the guys, starting off with sex on the coffee house table with Chandler. This makes Ross jealous. Some time later, Rachel fantasizes about Joey <i>and</i> Chandler (pointing out that "there were times where it wasn't even me", implying homosexual tendencies between the two men). Ross can't be more jealous of the guys for "sleeping" with Rachel. Meanwhile, Ross gets a pager at the number "55JIMBO" to receive notice when Carol goes into labor. People keep paging him with requests for man named "Andre", who is seemingly a gigalo at the number "55JUMBO".
</p><p>Things are starting to calm down in the lives of the friends, when Ross eavesdrops on Rachel fantasizing about him in her dreams. His euphoria is such that he starts jumping on the table, but slips and lands on Rachel, waking her up. Just as things may finally get started between the two, Ross' pager beeps, this time with the real thing - Carol's in labor, she's about to give birth - Ross is about to become a father.

</li><li>When Ethan shows up at the coffee house, and Ross puts his black mug down to go to the bathroom and give them privacy, he puts it down on the corner of the table. When Ethan and Monica sit down, it is in the middle of the table.
</li><li><a href="/wiki/Ross" title="Ross" class="mw-redirect">Ross</a> and <a href="/wiki/Monica" title="Monica" class="mw-redirect">Monica</a>'s cousin Nathan was previously mentioned in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_All_The_Poker" title="The One With All The Poker">The One With All The Poker</a>" (S1E18).

</li><li>This is the first time Chandler is picked upon for his mis-accentuation of sentences ("Could that report <i>be</i> any later?"), a running gag in the series.
</li><li>Rachel's erotic dreaming about the guys is featured again in "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Rachel%27s_Dream" title="The One With Rachel's Dream">The One With Rachel's Dream</a>" (S9E19).
<ul><li>Contrary to this episode, in the "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_Rachel%27s_Dream" title="The One With Rachel's Dream">The One With Rachel's Dream</a>", Rachel uses the dream to act upon her feelings and tell Joey of her crush. In this one, she neither has the time (as with Ross) nor the will (as with Chandler and Joey) to act upon her feelings.
</li></ul>
</li><li>In "<a href="/wiki/The_One_With_The_Flashback" title="The One With The Flashback">The One With The Flashback</a>", it is revealed that Rachel previously had another erotic dream with Chandler (in that case, a daydream) one year before the events of "<a href="/wiki/The_Pilot" title="The Pilot">The Pilot</a>".
</li><li>When Ross is ushering Monica, Rachel, Chandler, and Joey out of their apartments, Rachel puts on lipstick, explaining "there might be cute doctors there!". Indeed in the next episode, Rachel flirts with Carol's doctor.
</li><li>In the opening scene Rachel pours a cup of coffee and then sits on the couch holding the mostly full pot in the palm of her hand.
</li><li>Chandler mentions Rachel's attraction to doctors as having something to do with her father. Later in the series, she gets together with Ross, who although no one in the group acknowledges it, is in fact a Doctor in paleontology
</li></ul>
<ul><li> After Ethan tells Monica his true age, she briefly states she feels like "one of those ladies who has a guy named Chad." Alluding to her being a cougar. Courtney Cox would later on star in the television comedy "Cougar Town."
