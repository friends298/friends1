<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>Joey becomes a learning extension teacher in soap acting. Monica buys a bed from Janice's ex-husband, but the wrong one is delivered. Rachel convinces Ross to dine with her dad, who treats him even worse than he feared. The next day, Ross and Dr. Green find each-other making jokes about Rachel's chiropractor and general lack of good sense. When Joey hears one of his students is also auditioning for the same role he wants, he tries to sabotage him by giving him bad advice about how to play the character. While shopping with Monica, Joey sees something startling.
